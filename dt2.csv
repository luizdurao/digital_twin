J;"Min, QF; Lu, YG; Liu, ZY; Su, C; Wang, B";Machine Learning based Digital Twin Framework for Production Optimization in Petrochemical Industry;"digital twin; machine learning; internet of things; petrochemical industry; production control optimization";"Digital twins, along with the internet of things (IoT), data mining, and machine learning technologies, offer great potential in the transformation of today's manufacturing paradigm toward intelligent manufacturing. Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry.";1;2019;18
J;"Buisson, B; Lakehal, D";Towards an integrated machine-learning framework for model evaluation and uncertainty quantification;"Fluid flow simulation; Wall boiling; Data analytics; Digital Twin; Machine-learning; Data-driven models (DDM)";We introduce a new paradigm for treating and exploiting simulation data, serving in parallel as an alternative workflow for model evaluation and uncertainty quantification. Instead of reporting simulations of base-case and specific variations scenarios, databases covering a wide spectrum of operational conditions are built by means of machine-learning using sophisticated mathematical algorithms. While the approach works for all sorts of computer-aided engineering applications, the present contribution addresses the CFD/CMFD sub-branch, with application to a widely used benchmark of convective flow boiling. In addition to comparing simulation and experimental results on a case-by-case basis, machine-learning is used to create their respective (CFD and experiment) data-driven models (DDM), which will in a later stage serve for assessing the predictive performance of the CFD models over a wider range of experimental conditions, hence providing a high-level classification of their range of applicability.;0;2019;15
J;"Shivajee, V; Singh, RK; Rastogi, S";Manufacturing conversion cost reduction using quality control tools and digitization of real-time data;"Manufacturing conversion cost; DMAIC; Quality control (QC) tools; Digitization; Industry 4.0; Sustainable manufacturing";Two-wheeler automobile manufacturers in India are currently facing a big pressure to reduce the overall manufacturing cost in order to sustain the position in hypercompetitive domestic and global market. The manufacturing conversion cost is one part of the overall manufacturing cost. It consists of three major components i.e. product or parts scrap cost, consumables cost and tool cost. The scrap cost is the cost of defective products, which are not produced in accordance with standard and can't be sent to market. The consumables cost is the cost of other than basic raw material used in manufacturing i.e. filters, filler materials, fuel, gases, chemical, coolant and lubricants etc. This study has tried to emphasise role of conversion cost in making organisations cost competitive. Case study-based approach is used in this study. The case manufacturing system comprises three main processes: machine shop, frame plant (weld and paint shop) and assembly shop. In frame plant, paint shop and weld shop are the two main sub sections of this automobile manufacturing. More than 50% of overall manufacturing conversion cost is consumed in these two areas. This study attempts to illustrate the reduction of the manufacturing conversion cost by prioritizing and analysing the cost factors using DMAIC (define-measure-analyzeimprove-control) approach using quality control (QC) tools like Pareto chart, Cause & effect diagram and digitization of real time data. Authors have identified eighteen elements of conversion cost in this study. It has been observed from this study that even small saving in conversion cost per vehicle i.e. INR 24.18 (0.35 US$) per vehicle has resulted in annual saving of 2.2 millionUSD.Initiatives taken by this organisation for cost saving has also resulted in cleaner production and more sustainable manufacturing processes. Findings will be motivating to other manufacturers for reducing manufacturing cost using QC tools on smaller and insignificant activities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;0;2019;13

J;"Whelan, G; McDowell, DL";Uncertainty quantification in ICME workflows for fatigue critical computational modeling;"Uncertainty; Fatigue; ICME; Microstructure";Fatigue critical applications of digital twins require an emphasis on computing the driving forces to form and grow fatigue cracks in materials. The concept of a digital twin is extended to incorporate microstructure-sensitive fatigue in the context of ICME. Uncertainty is ubiquitous in ICME workflows, and robust uncertainty quantification strategies can facilitate reliable prognosis support. This work addresses epistemic uncertainty from model form and parameters for microstructure-sensitive simulation of fatigue. Model form uncertainty is studied through statistical volume element sampling strategies. A strategy to reduce this uncertainty is applied and a second study of model parameter uncertainty stemming from macroscopic calibration of a Ti-6Al-4V constitutive model is discussed.;0;2019;10

This social manufacturing paradigm drives an increased demand for makers to track the authenticity and quality of products. A new decentralized blockchain-driven model, named Makerchain, is presented to handle the cyber-credit of social manufacturing among various makers.

J;"Omer, M; Margetts, L; Mosleh, MH; Hewitt, S; Parwaiz, M";Use of gaming technology to bring bridge inspection to the office;"Bridge; inspection; virtual reality; LIDAR; digital twin; evaluation; maintenance; non-destructive methods";This paper proposes a novel method for bridge inspection that essentially digitises bridges using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) so that they can be later inspected in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The work uses conventional terrestrial LIDAR together with affordable VR hardware and freely available software development kits originally intended for authoring computer games. The resulting VR app is evaluated for a case study involving a typical masonry bridge, comparing the proposed technique with traditional inspection methods. The new approach promises to be highly effective in terms of interpretation of results, accessibility to critical areas and safety of inspectors. The work represents an important step towards the creation of digital twins of important assets in the built environment. Recent bridge collapse incidents have affected local economies, traffic congestion, and in some extreme cases led to a loss of life. The work is timely as law making agencies are paying greater attention to structural rehabilitation. This paper will be of particular interest to bridge engineers, construction professionals and law makers and could lead to future revisions of bridge inspection processes and standards.;0;2019;16
J;"Hirschvogel, M; Jagschies, L; Maier, A; Wildhirt, SM; Gee, MW";An in silico twin for epicardial augmentation of the failing heart;"cardiac augmentation; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular mechanics; heart failure; heart modeling; ventricular assist device";Advances in ventricular assist device (VAD) technology for the treatment of end-stage congestive heart failure (CHF) are needed to cope with the increasing numbers of patients that cannot be provided with donor hearts for transplantation. We develop and investigate a novel extravascular VAD technology that provides biventricular, epicardial pressure support for the failing heart. This novel VAD concept avoids blood contact that is accompanied with typical complications such as coagulation and infections. To date, in vivo porcine model results with a prototype of the implant exist, further studies to improve the implant's performance and promote its applicability in humans are needed. In this contribution, we present a personalised functional digital twin of the heart, the vascular system, and the novel VAD technology in terms of a calibrated, customized computational model. The calibration procedure is based on patient-specific measurements and is performed by solving an inverse problem. This in silico model is able to (a) confirm in vivo experimental data, (b) predict healthy and pathologic ventricular function, and (c) assess the beneficial impact of the novel VAD concept to a high level of fidelity. The model shows very good agreement with in vivo data and reliably predicts increases in stroke volume and left ventricular pressure with increasing ventricular support. Furthermore, the digital twin allows insight into quantities that are poorly or not at all amenable in any experimental setup. Conclusively, the model's ability to link integral hemodynamic variables to local tissue mechanical deformation makes it a highly valuable tool for the dimensioning of novel VAD technologies and future treatment strategies in heart failure. The presented in silico twin enhances in vivo studies by facilitating the accessibility and increasing the range of quantities of interest. Because of its flexibility in the assessment of design variants and optimization loops, it may substantially contribute to a reduction of the amount of animal experiments in this and similar settings.;0;2019;23

Thus, motion control systems built with modular approach has ever-longer lists of demands for performance improvement. This paper presents software-based integral product architecture for the modular motion control system of a RFC linear motor motion stage: a model-based DOB for residual vibration suppression. First, the modular motion control system of a linear motor motion stage with air bearing is introduced and its digital twin or multi-rate simulation model is verified with experiments. Then, software-based integral product approach or a model-based DOB is applied to improve the performances of the linear motor stage and its feasibility is confirmed based on the simulation model. Auxiliary software to implement the model-based DOB into a commercial motion control are developed including excitation, DOB user code and data import.

Refrigeration is also key to enable successful transcontinental export to distant markets. To minimize the environmental impact of the cold chain and to optimize logistics, a better knowledge of the fruit quality evolution within individual shipments would be extremely valueable. For this purpose, a digital fruit twin is developed, based on mechanistic modeling. This digital twin simulates the thermal behavior of mango fruit throughout the cold chain, based on the measured environmental temperature conditions, namely the air temperature in the vicinity of the fruit. At the same time, the evolution of associated quality attributes, due to enzymatically-driven, temperature-dependent biochemical degradation reactions, is quantified. Also, a biophysical counterpart of real mango fruit an innovative fruit simulator sensing device - was developed and used for model validation of fruit pulp temperatures. We identified - in-silico - the impact of the unique delivery air temperature history and cold chain length on fruit quality evolution for actual maritime vs. airfreight transport pathways. Digital twins were found to provide complementary insights in the thermophysical behavior of fruit, particularly in supply chains of very perishable species, and for storage at low airflow rates. Such mechanistic modeling enabled to understand, record, and predict where temperature-dependent fruit quality loss occurs in each supply chain. In that way, digital twins can help to improve refrigeration processes and logistics to reduce food losses, thereby making the refrigerated supply chain greener.;1;2019;17

J;"Koenig, F; Found, P; Kumar, M";Improving maintenance quality in airport baggage handling operations;"condition monitoring; time-based maintenance; reclaim carousel maintenance; Service 4; 0; wireless battery powered sensors";"Purpose: The findings of a recent study at Heathrow are presented. The objective of the study was an operational quality issue with the baggage reclaim process and addressed the problem of unexpected downtime of baggage carousels during operational hours. For airlines and airports, the reclaim carousel is a key element in the process whereby passengers decide about the quality of their journey. Failure that leads to longer waiting times or even the relocation of baggage to another carousel results in passenger dissatisfaction and therefore needs to be avoided. The current regime of 'time-based' or 'preventative' maintenance can be classified as 'run-to-break' or 'reactive', causing frequent and costly downtime. A novel condition-based monitoring method to improve the reliability of the time-critical baggage reclaim process is described. Reclaim carousel maintenance quality was improved by the development of innovative condition-based maintenance systems designed to meet the requirements of twenty-first century airport systems and Industry 4.0 in cooperation with Siemens DF (digital factory) and their internet of things (IoT) platform Mindsphere. Methodology: A technical action research approach was undertaken at one of the biggest capital airport baggage handling systems in Europe. From June 2016 a condition monitoring pilot system on one operational carousel was established using engineering cycle theory. A solution was designed, installed, continually monitored and the results discussed with practitioners from the operation and maintenance (O&M) department. Root cause analysis was used to identify reasons for abrasive wear, followed by failure simulations during operation. Technical vibration data was collected so that an adequate condition monitoring system could be developed and optimised that improved the maintenance quality of reclaim carousels and reduced the costs associated with unexpected failure of the baggage handling system. Findings: Run-to-break maintenance is never conducive to quality maintenance and control and results in great uncertainty and unreliability. Meeting the objective of improving quality was difficult because the assets are hidden and baggage carousels are in constant use; however using wireless beacon technology it was possible to identify what problems might occur and when. Using the cloud-based IoT and Airport 4.0 also necessitated many sophisticated checks and measures, which are now in development. This study highlights the value of changing from the antiquated 'run to break' maintenance of hidden assets in airport baggage handling carousels to high-quality maintenance through the use of condition monitoring using wireless vibration sensors linked to a cloud-based IoT ecosystem. Originality/Value: With this solution in operation, maintenance quality has been approved and heavy damage can be avoided. The solution addresses problems caused by a variety of hidden equipment needing the highest possible maintenance quality. It can instantly secure the best quality of service for critical assets in an operation that cannot afford any unplanned downtime.";0;2019;18

Accordingly, various architectures for the realization of Digital Twin use cases are conceptualized. There lacks, however, a clear, encompassing architecture covering necessary components of a Digital Twin to realize various use cases in an intelligent automation system. In this contribution, the added value of a Digital Twin in an intelligent automation system is highlighted and various existing definitions and architectures of the Digital Twin are discussed. Flowingly, an architecture for a Digital Twin and an architecture for an Intelligent Digital Twin and their required components are proposed, with which use cases such as plug and produce, self-x and predictive maintenance are enabled. In the opinion of the authors, a Digital Twin requires three main characteristics: synchronization with the real asset, active data acquisition from the real environment and the ability of simulation. In addition to all the characteristics of a Digital Twin, an Intelligent Digital Twin must also include the characteristics of Artificial Intelligence. The Intelligent Digital Twin can be used for the realization of the autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems. In order to realize the proposed architecture for a Digital Twin, several methods, namely the Anchor-Point-Method, a method for heterogeneous data acquisition and data integration as well as an agent-based method for the development of a co-simulation between Digital Twins were implemented and evaluated.;0;2019;21
J;"Tagliavini, G; Defraeye, T; Carmeliet, J";Multiphysics modeling of convective cooling of non-spherical, multi-material fruit to unveil its quality evolution throughout the cold chain;"Fruit cooling; Computational fluid dynamics; Cold chain; Quality prediction; Mangos; Digital twin";Convective cooling is essential in many supply chain unit operations for refrigerated transport and cold storage of fresh products. Fruit must be kept at low temperatures to preserve quality and to slow down biochemically-driven food degradation. Along the cold chain, heterogeneities in temperatures are present among individual products, which influence the resulting product quality, causing significant food losses. This study presents a thermo-fluid dynamic model of a single mango fruit to better understand the convective cooling behavior of fruits with more complex, non-spherical shapes and a heterogeneous composition. To explain the biochemical and biological processes affecting the product's final quality, experimental data from the literature are used to calibrate kinetic rate laws for the prediction of different quality attributes (overall quality, flesh firmness, titratable acidity, total soluble solids and vitamin content) over time. The accuracy of airflow modeling and of applying a realistic fruit shape are assessed. It is quantified how much higher airspeeds lead to faster cooling of the pulp and seed, and how strong non-uniform temperature heterogeneities are inside the fruit. From sensitivity analysis, air temperature has the most impact on fruit temperature during cooling, while thermal properties and fruit size have a minor influence. The evolution of the quality attributes is shown at different temperatures, and the heterogeneities in quality within the mango fruit are also investigated. The obtained insights will help advance cooling process optimization for other complex-shaped, multi-material fruit and vegetables. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

This project aims to conduct a systematic critical review including a bibliography analysis on delay literature in construction. The main questions consider what has been learnt from a decade investigating delay causes and effects in the construction literature and what factors have been missed in the literature. This paper also presents a new and challenging question regarding how digital tools and associated technologies may prevent any delay in construction projects, which can change the research direction from delay investigations to identifying prevention factors. The paper identifies the delay dataset, including 493 papers investigating delay in construction, and establishes a specific dataset of papers focusing on delay effects and causes (DEC), including 94 selected papers covering different factors examined in over 29 countries such as Iran, India, Turkey, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Cambodia, Oman, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the US, the UK, and Egypt. In addition, the paper identifies 30 critical factors with the frequency of occurrences over three times in the DEC dataset and computes their medians of ranking. This paper also discusses digital tools and methods that can be used for delay analysis and preventions, including MS Project, Oracle Primavera P6, and Open Plan by Deltek. The paper discusses the project schedule delay analysis from project management methodology perspectives. It also discusses the current method's limitations and future directions, which are based on the identification of the deficiency areas. In total, four overlooked factors are identified and suggested, including faulty data analysis, unmatched structure of the research questionnaires with new knowledge and standards [e.g., Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)], overlooked effects of digital technologies [e.g., Digital twin, Navisworks, Building Information Model (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Integrated Project Delivery (IPD)], and ignored job-site technologies. In addition, the paper presents the DEC model for future studies, including four main key factors. These factors are resources (e.g., project budgets, labour, material, equipment, and digital tool), project context, stakeholders performance (e.g., owner/client, consultant/designer, contractor, vendor/supplier), and external factors (e.g., ground condition, site location, regulation, natural disaster), which may significantly affect delay prevention and should be concurrently considered in the future delay investigations, since they may be required for designing an effective mitigation strategy when these proof points are identified. This would significantly help to utilise digital systems to prevent time overruns in different construction contexts.;0;2019;37

To this end, it delves into the issue by analysing the key requirements for enabling a scalable factory architecture characterized by access to services, aggregation of data, and orchestration of production processes. Then, the paper revises the state-of-the-art w.r.t. these requirements and proposes an architectural framework conjugating features of both service-oriented and data-sharing architectures.

The proposed model identifies the structural primitives, interfaces, and behaviors of the highly connected factory work cell in which wireless technology is used for significant data flows involved in control algorithms. The model includes the parametric definitions to encapsulate information loss, delay, and mutation associated with the wireless network, and it identifies pertinent wireless information flows.;0;2019;22
J;Kockmann, N;Digital methods and tools for chemical equipment and plants;;The Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and the digitalization of business processes offer new opportunities and business models for the process industry, including education and training. The ProcessNet Symposion in Tutzing, Germany, held in April 2018 dealt with digitalization in the process industry. The outcome was described in 12 theses. Lean processes and integrated, software-assisted workflows are essential foundations, on which platform solutions and digital tools such as data analysis, networking systems, and artificial intelligence can be based. The digital twin of modular equipment, processes or entire plants improves planning processes and simplifies work flow in production. Interdisciplinary communication, the acquisition and evaluation of knowledge and lifelong learning will become more and more important.;0;2019;8
J;"Kokkas, A; Vosniakos, GC";An Augmented Reality approach to factory layout design embedding operation simulation;"Augmented Reality; Facility layout; Dynamic simulation; Functional modelling; Machinery programming; Digital factory; Flexible manufacturing cell";The subject of this work is layout planning of machinery, especially for Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), using Augmented Reality tools. The goal is for the user to evaluate suggested layouts by taking into account non-measurable factors, such as operator experience, empirical or non-tacit knowledge and on-site impression. By reference to existing machinery (in the case study: CNC lathe and an industrial robot) the missing elements of a complete FMS cell (conveyor belts, automatic storage and retrieval system, other robots and CNC machines etc.) are super-imposed. The functional connection is enabled between the collaborating real-physical and the virtual machinery of the layout in the most convincing way, i.e., by simulation of the full production process involving movement, manipulation and processing of parts by real and virtual equipment in parallel and serial co-existence. This involves predefined scenarios that can be experienced exploiting alternative equipment in the same application and alternative layouts assessed in analogous applications. Static and dynamic simulation of the manufacturing cell offers the possibility of extensive analysis of the selected layout by walk-through navigation. The application is implemented in ARKit (TM) API tool and Unity3D (TM).;0;2019;11

We propose a proof-of-concept instrumented glove with only a few strain gage sensors and a microcontroller that continuously tracks and records the hand configuration during actual use. At the heart of our approach is a trainable system that can predict the fourteen joint angles in the hand using only a small set of strain sensors. First, ten strain gages are placed at various joints in the hand to optimize the sensor layout using the English letters in the American Sign Language (ASL) as a benchmark for assessment. Next, the best sensor configurations for three through ten strain gages are computed using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Following the layout optimization, our approach learns a mapping between the sensor readouts to the actual joint angles optically captured using a Leap Motion system. Five regression methods including linear, quadratic, and neural regression are then used to train the mapping between the strain gage data and the corresponding joint angles. The final proposed model involves four strain gages mapped to the fourteen joint angles using a two-layer feed-forward neural network (NN).;0;2019;7
J;"Lu, RD; Brilakis, I";Digital twinning of existing reinforced concrete bridges from labelled point clusters;"Digital twin; IFC; BrIM; BIM; Point cloud data";The automation of digital twinning for existing reinforced concrete bridges from point clouds remains an unresolved problem, Whilst current methods can automatically detect bridge objects in point clouds in the form of labelled point clusters, the fitting of accurate 3D shapes to point clusters remains largely human dependent largely. 95% of the total manual modelling time is spent on customizing shapes and fitting them correctly. The challenges exhibited in the fitting step are due to the irregular geometries of existing bridges. Existing methods can fit geometric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders to point clusters, assuming bridges are comprised of generic shapes. However, the produced geometric digital twins are too ideal to depict the real geometry of bridges. In addition, none of the existing methods have explicitly demonstrated how to evaluate the resulting Industry Foundation Classes bridge data models in terms of spatial accuracy using quantitative measurements. In this article, we tackle these challenges by delivering a slicing-based object fitting method that can generate the geometric digital twin of an existing reinforced concrete bridge from four types of labelled point cluster. The quality of the generated models is gauged using cloud-to-cloud distance-based metrics. Experiments on ten bridge point cloud datasets indicate that the method achieves an average modelling distance of 7.05 cm (while the manual method achieves 7.69 cm), and an average modelling time of 37.8 s. This is a huge leap over the current practice of digital twinning performed manually.;0;2019;16

As a consequence, a crucial issue for the maritime industry is to develop technologies able to increase the ship efficiency, by reducing fuel consumption and unnecessary maintenance operations. For example, the marine fouling phenomenon has a deep impact, since to prevent or reduce its growth which affects the ship consumption, costly drydockings for cleaning the hull and the propeller are needed and must be scheduled based on a speed loss estimation. In this work a data driven Digital Twin of the ship is built, leveraging on the large amount of information collected from the on-board sensors, and is used for estimating the speed loss due to marine fouling. A thorough comparison between the proposed method and ISO 19030, which is the de-facto standard for dealing with this task, is carried out on real-world data coming from two Handymax chemical/product tankers. Results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposal and its better speedloss prediction accuracy with respect to the ISO 19030, thus allowing reducing the fuel consumption due to fouling.;0;2019;14

Thus, IoT promises to transfer traditional industry to advance digital industry known as the Industry 4.0. At the core of the Industry 4.0 are the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) that led to the development of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) and industrial wireless sensor and actuator networks (IWSANs). These networks play a central role of connecting machines, parts, products, and humans and create a diverse set of new applications to support intelligent and autonomous decision making. The IWSAN is a promising technology for numerous industrial applications because of their several potential benefits such as simple deployment, low cost, less complexity, and mobility support. However, despite such benefits, they impose several unique challenges at different layers of the protocol stack when deploying them for various monitoring and control applications in the Industry 4.0. In this article, we explore IWSAN, its applications, requirements, challenges, and solutions in the context of industrial control applications. Our main focus is on the medium access control (MAC) layer that can be exploited to satisfy such requirements. Our discussion presents extensive background study of the MAC schemes and it reviews the MAC protocols of the existing wireless standards and technologies. A number of application-specific MAC protocols developed to support industrial applications, which are not part of these standards, are also elaborated. We rationalize to what extent the existing standards and protocols help in solving such requirements as laid down by the Industry 4.0. In the end, we emphasize on existing challenges and present important future directions.;0;2019;32
J;"Kaewunruen, S; Lian, Q";Digital twin aided sustainability-based lifecycle management for railway turnout systems;"BIM; 6D; Digital twin; Turnout; Level 3 model; IS; Schedule; Costs; Carbon; Life-cycle";Railway turnouts or so-called 'switches and crossings' are complex systems by nature of design and construction. Railway turnouts are used to change direction of trains from one to another. They require high-quality construction and maintenance, in order to minimise rapid degradation and component failures that could result in train derailments. Due to the complexity of railway turnouts, the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance can be improved by integrating existing practice by Building Information Modelling (BIM). This research establishes and analyses the world's first 6D BIM for life cycle management of a railway turnout system. The BIM (Level 3) has integrated 6-dimensions of field data information based on Revit-2018 and Navisworks-2018 platforms. The digital twins of a railway turnout in 3D embrace time schedule, costs and sustainability across the whole life cycle. The use of BIM for railway turnout systems has the potential to improve the overall information flow of the turnout planning and design, manufacturing pre-assembly and logistic, construction and installation, operation and management and demolition, thereby achieving better project performance and quality. Based on integrated information of railway turnout system, the 6D BIM has the ability to assess on economic, management and sustainability, and achieve a balance among them. This is the word first to demonstrate that BIM can fully deliver its essential benefits by information sharing, easing technical communication, improving design quality, reducing of design errors, accelerating implementation, speeding up work, shortening construction duration, reducing construction costs, enhancing carbon efficiency, supporting project management, and providing its owners with higher operational efficiency over the railway turnout system life-cycle. The results reveal that embodied material emission is the main contributor towards carbon footprint, especially produced during the manufacturing stage. The reconstruction stage contributes the most expensive phase of life cycle. The insight will significantly benefit the co-value creation among engineers, project managers, technicians, and senior management team. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;0;2019;15
J;"Fotland, G; Haskins, C; Rolvag, T";Trade study to select best alternative for cable and pulley simulation for cranes on offshore vessels;"cable; crane; digital twin; FEM; MBS; pulley; simulation";Cranes on offshore vessels are subjected to crane dynamics, structural couplings to the vessel, and environmental influence by waves and currents. The recent trend has been to use larger cranes on smaller vessels, which makes the lifting operation more complex and potentially dangerous. The use of digital twins (DTs) is emerging as one way to enable safer operations, real-time simulation, and maintenance prediction. On offshore vessels, a DT can monitor the lifting operation to create a safer work environment. The SPADE model has been used as a framework toward the creation of a DT of cranes on offshore vessels. Several cases involving simulation of cranes revealed the lack of an adequate simulation of cable and pulleys suitable for use in a DT. The simulation is important for accurate results and for implementation in control systems. A trade study was performed to determine a numerical method adequate for cable and pulley simulation. The trade study identified the absolute nodal coordinate formulation in the framework of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian as a promising numerical formulation.;1;;12
J;"Gupta, A; Basu, B";Sustainable Primary Aluminium Production: Technology Status and Future Opportunities;"Aluminium smelting; Low-energy cell; Process control; Drained cathode cell; Inert anode; Vertical cell; Industry 4; 0; Digital twin";Energy and greenhouse gas emission remain the major technological challenges to the aluminium production. Over the last few decades, aluminium industries have been aiming for higher production volumes through capacity creep in the existing smelters with reasonable additional investment. However, a strong focus on specific energy consumption has always been part of technology considerations, and this aspect is even more critical today from the point of view of long-term sustainability. Through research and innovations in design, control and operations of Hall-Heroult cell, modern smelters are achieving a benchmark performance as low as 13 kWh/kg of Al at commercial scale and 12 kWh/kg of Al at pilot scale. There is also significant research effort put on alternate technology platforms like drained cathode cell and inert anode. Although there are many pilot-scale demonstrations, many critical issues like operating cost and stability problems in drained cell and higher specific energy in inert anode need to be addressed for commercial consideration of these technologies. Industry 4.0 platform technologies like internet of things, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, etc., are opening up further opportunities for benchmark performance to the modern smelters. Digital twin is such an emerging technology for predictive control and operation and will be a key driver for low-energy cells. Based on a discussion on the status of present technology, this article presents a comprehensive review of the technological progress of aluminium smelting and emerging new technology like Industry 4.0, towards reduction of energy and making aluminium production sustainable.;0;2019;16

Such changes could then promote the development of platforms that ultimately provide benefits for citizens such as convenience, safety, and cost savings. Currently, the development of technologies for SECs focuses on independent products and unit technology. However, this is problematic, as it may not be possible to develop sustainable cities if there is a lack of connectivity between various elements within the SEC. To solve such problems, this paper presents an AI-based physical and virtual platform using a 5-layer architecture to develop a sustainable smart energy city (SSEC). The architecture employs both a top-down and bottom-up approach and the links between each energy element in the SSEC can readily be analyzed. The economic analysis based on return on investment (ROI) is carried out by comparing the economic benefits before and after the application of this system. Deploying the proposed platform will enable the speedy development and application of new services for SSECs and will provide SSECs with measures to ensure sustainable development, such as rapid urban development, and cost reductions.;0;2019;30
J;"Soares, RM; Camara, MM; Feital, T; Pinto, JC";Digital Twin for Monitoring of Industrial Multi-Effect Evaporation;"digital twin; multi-effect evaporation; evaporation modeling; dynamic model; sugar industry; monitoring; softsensor";Digital twins are rigorous mathematical models that can be used to represent the operation of real systems. This connection allows for deeper understanding of the actual states of the analyzed system through estimation of variables that are difficult to measure otherwise. In this context, the present manuscript describes the successful implementation of a digital twin to represent a four-stage multi-effect evaporation train from an industrial sugar-cane processing unit. Particularly, the complex phenomenological effects, including the coupling between thermodynamic and fluid dynamic effects, and the low level of instrumentation in the plant constitute major challenges for adequate process operation. For this reason, dynamic mass and energy balances were developed, implemented and validated with actual industrial data, in order to provide process information for decision-making in real time. For example, the digital twin was able to indicate failure of process sensors and to provide estimates for the affected variables in real time, improving the robustness of the operation and constituting an important tool for process monitoring.;0;2019;14

The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.;0;2019;28
J;"Tao, F; Qi, QL; Wang, LH; Nee, AYC";Digital Twins and Cyber-Physical Systems toward Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0: Correlation and Comparison;"Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Digital twin (DT); Smart manufacturing; Correlation and comparison";State-of-the-art technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing (CC), big data analytics (BDA), and artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly stimulated the development of smart manufacturing. An important prerequisite for smart manufacturing is cyber-physical integration, which is increasingly being embraced by manufacturers. As the preferred means of such integration, cyber-physical systems (CPS) and digital twins (DTs) have gained extensive attention from researchers and practitioners in industry. With feedback loops in which physical processes affect cyber parts and vice versa, CPS and DTs can endow manufacturing systems with greater efficiency, resilience, and intelligence. CPS and DTs share the same essential concepts of an intensive cyber-physical connection, real-time interaction, organization integration, and in-depth collaboration. However, CPS and DTs are not identical from many perspectives, including their origin, development, engineering practices, cyber-physical mapping, and core elements. In order to highlight the differences and correlation between them, this paper reviews and analyzes CPS and DTs from multiple perspectives. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

J;"Rodemann, T; Eckhardt, T; Unger, R; Schwan, T";Using Agent-Based Customer Modeling for the Evaluation of EV Charging Systems;"EV charging; multi-agent system; digital twin; customer satisfaction indicator";The development of efficient electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure requires a modeling of customer behavior at an appropriate level of detail. Since only limited information about real customers is available, most simulation approaches employ a stochastic approach by combining known or estimated customer features with random variations. A typical example is to model EV charging customers by an arrival and a targeted departure time, plus the requested amount of energy or increased state of charge (SoC), where values are drawn from normal (Gaussian) distributions with mean and variance values derived from user studies of obviously limited sample size. In this work, we compare this basic approach with a more detailed customer model employing a multi-agent simulation (MAS) framework in order to investigate how a customer behavior that responds to external factors (like weather) or historical data (like satisfaction in past charging sessions) impacts the essential key performance indicators of the charging system. Our findings show that small changes in the way customers are modeled can lead to quantitative and qualitative differences in the simulated performance of EV charging systems.;0;2019;16
J;"Tabar, RS; Warmefjord, K; Soderberg, R";A method for identification and sequence optimisation of geometry spot welds in a digital twin context;"Manufacturing and assembly; spot welding sequence; geometrical variation; optimisation; tolerance design";Geometrical variation is the main cause of the aesthetic and functional problems in the product geometry. Variation and disturbances are caused by several sources during the manufacturing process. In the automotive industry, one of the main sources of variation is the spot welding sequence. Optimising this sequence is of combinatorial Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP)-hard problems. In a typical automotive sheet metal assembly, there are a large number of spot welds. Today, if the number of spot welds in a sub-assembly is more than 10, the sequence optimisation will be a challenging and time-consuming task. Therefore, industry is mainly dependent on the experiential approach or simultaneous welding simulations for predicting the geometrical outcome. In this paper, a method is introduced to identify the geometry weld points to reduce the optimisation problem size in a geometry assurance digital twin context. This method is then applied to three automotive body-in-white assemblies and optimisation is performed. The results show that reducing the size of the problem by the proposed approach can help to save a considerable amount of time while getting geometrical outcomes within the satisfactory error levels.;0;2019;12
J;"Ghosh, AK; Ullah, AMMS; Kubo, A";Hidden Markov model-based digital twin construction for futuristic manufacturing systems;"Complex phenomena; digital twin; hidden Markov model; manufacturing systems; surface roughness";This paper addresses the construction of digital twins (exact mirror images of real-world in cyberspace) using hidden Markov models for the futuristic manufacturing systems known as Industry 4.0. The proposed digital twin consists of two components namely model component and simulation component. The model component forms a Markov chain that encapsulates the dynamics underlying the phenomenon by using some discrete states and their transition probabilities. The simulation component recreates the phenomenon using a Monte Carlo simulation process. The efficacy of the proposed digital twin construction methodology is shown by a case study, where the digital twin of the surface roughness of a surface created by successive grinding operations is described. The developers of the cyber-physical systems will be benefitted from the outcomes of this study because these systems need the computable virtual abstractions of the manufacturing phenomena to address the issues related to the maturity index of futuristic manufacturing systems (i.e., understand, predict, decide, and adopt).;1;2019;15
J;"Mandolla, C; Petruzzelli, AM; Percoco, G; Urbinati, A";Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry;"Blockchain; Digital technology; Additive manufacturing; Digital twin; Aircraft industry";Blockchain is becoming a widespread digital technology that allows every transaction to be tracked in an inviolable way, hence making it possible to go back through the entire history of products and product components. Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure.

J;"Mukherjee, T; DebRoy, T";Printability of 316 stainless steel;"Directed energy deposition; wire arc additive manufacturing; powder bed fusion; heat transfer and fluid flow; residual stresses; distortion; alloying element vaporisation; lack of fusion defect";A printability database can help in the selection of a printing process-alloy combination to reduce, and in some cases avoid, common defects in printed parts. The extensive testing of parts is not a viable option for determining printability because printing processes are inherently slow and expensive. Here we evaluate printability of stainless steel 316 by evaluating its susceptibilities to residual stresses, distortion, composition change and lack of fusion defects for laser (DED-L) and arc (DED-GMA) based directed energy deposition and laser powder bed fusion (PBF-L) processes using well-tested mechanistic models. Among these three processes, DED-GMA makes printed parts of 316 stainless steels most susceptible to residual stresses and distortion. High depth of penetration during DED-GMA makes components least susceptible to lack of fusion defects. Loss of volatile alloying elements from the tiny pools in PBF-L makes deposits the most vulnerable to composition change.;1;2019;8

J;"Islavath, SR; Deb, D; Kumar, H";Life cycle analysis and damage prediction of a longwall powered support using 3D numerical modelling techniques;"Powered support; Cyclic load; Fatigue failure; Operational life; Safety factor and damage";Powered shield support consists of structural members like hydraulic legs, canopy, base, goaf shield, lemniscate links and several pins connecting these members. All these members experience cyclic loading as the shearer cuts coal and the longwall face advances. During the operational life of a shield support, members may be damaged since loading conditions vary widely depending on the type of roof and floor strata. This study focuses on the analysis of responses of various members of a powered support in terms of stresses, minimum number of operational loading cycles for a given safety factor and the damage under cyclic loading conditions. Three-dimensional finite element models of a longwall panel are firstly analysed having powered support, rock strata, coal seam and goaf to determine the typical loading patterns those may occur on top of the canopy. Then these loading patterns are applied on a digital twin shield structure as cyclic loads for estimation of fatigue responses of various members. The study reveals that the most effected zone of the entire shield structure lies in goaf shield between the connectors of two lemniscate links. The links are the major load-bearing members and hence, their connection with the base and pins are severely also affected due to cyclic loading.;0;2019;15

Then, the physics subsystem, information integration subsystem, network integration subsystem, data integration subsystem, and visualization integration subsystem for SMIS were proposed through the overall architecture of SMIS. Finally, the above integrated subsystems were collected together to deduce the implementation path of SMIS. Four reference subsystems for SMIS proposed in this paper have achieved good effects in the projects we participated in, which were organized by the state.

Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.;1;2019;14
J;"Martynov, K; Wever, U";On polynomial hyperreduction for nonlinear structural mechanics;"digital twin technology; nonlinear model order reduction; polynomial approximation; proper orthogonal decomposition; structural mechanics";This paper proposes an approach for hyperreduction of nonlinear structural mechanics equations. For hyperreduction, the nonlinear term is approximated by the third-degree multivariate polynomials represented in terms of a monomial basis. The chosen basis leads to an ill-conditioned minimization problem with the multivariate Vandermonde matrix. The condition number of the resulting problem is significantly improved by choosing an appropriate sparse subset of the initial basis. As a byproduct of the sparse basis, the evaluation time for the hyperreduced model is reduced drastically. The performance of the new approach is demonstrated for two typical applications.;0;2019;17
J;"Wang, XV; Wang, LH";Digital twin-based WEEE recycling, recovery and remanufacturing in the background of Industry 4.0;"WEEE; waste electronics; remanufacturing; digital twin; Industry 4; 0";The waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) recovery can be categorised into two types, i.e. recycling at the material level and remanufacturing at the component level. However, the WEEE recovery is facing enormous challenges of diversified individuals, lack of product knowledge, distributed location, and so forth. On the other hand, the latest ICT provides new methods and opportunities for industrial operation and management. Thus, in this research digital twin and Industry 4.0 enablers are introduced to the WEEE remanufacturing industry. The goal is to provide an integrated and reliable cyber-avatar of the individual WEEE, thus forming personalised service system. The main contribution presented in this paper is the novel digital twin-based system for the WEEE recovery to support the manufacturing/remanufacturing operations throughout the product's life cycle, from design to recovery. Meanwhile, the international standard-compliant data models are also developed to support WEEE recovery services with high data interoperability.

A systematic virtual model mirroring the real world of manufacturing system is essential to bridge the gap between its design and operation. This paper presents a digital twin-driven methodology for rapid individualised designing of the automated flow-shop manufacturing system. The digital twin merges physics-based system modelling and distributed semi-physical simulation to provide engineering solution analysis capabilities and generates an authoritative digital design of the system at pre-production phase. An effective feedbacking of collected decision-support information from the intelligent multi-objective optimisation of the dynamic execution is presented to boost the applicability of the digital twin vision in the designing of AFMS. Finally, a bi-level iterative coordination mechanism is proposed to achieve optimal design performance for required functions of AFMS. A case study is conducted to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.;5;2019;17

Given the nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty involved during the process of machinery degradation, proper design and adaptability of a Digital Twin model remain a challenge. This paper presents a Digital Twin reference model for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The requirements for constructing the Digital Twin model are discussed, and a model updating scheme based on parameter sensitivity analysis is proposed to enhance the model adaptability. Experimental data are collected from a rotor system that emulates an unbalance fault and its progression. The data are then input to a Digital Twin model of the rotor system to investigate its ability of unbalance quantification and localisation for fault diagnosis. The results show that the constructed Digital Twin rotor model enables accurate diagnosis and adaptive degradation analysis.;0;2019;15

Digital twin, a new emerging and fast growing technology which connects the physical and virtual world, has attracted much attention worldwide recently. This paper presents a new method for product design based on the digital twin approach. The development of product design is briefly introduced first. The framework of digital twin-driven product design (DTPD) is then proposed and analysed. A case is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed DTPD method.;9;2019;19

The fast paced evolution of the technology has to be reflected in the common ground between the machines and the operators. The introduction of advanced, flexible and adaptable Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) will empower the operators with information and custom tools to be more productive in a safer way. This work presents totally functional hardware and a novel software architecture to build flexible advanced HMI interfaces that will provide adaptable and useful information to the operator of the machines. Industrial protocols are used to receive real-time data. A USB camera can be plugged to enable the utilisation of Computer Vision algorithms. A touch display shows adaptable interfaces composed of (a) 3D interactive graphics, (b) texts and 2D images, (c) the camera feed and (d) user interface controls to enable the interaction with the operators.

J;"Martin, G; Marty, C; Bornoff, R; Poppe, A; Onushkin, G; Rencz, M; Yu, J";Luminaire Digital Design Flow with Multi-Domain Digital Twins of LEDs;"LED digital twin; design flow; multi-domain compact model; tool agnostic; multi-LED";At present, when designing a Light Emitting Diode (LED) luminaire, different strategies of development are followed depending on the size of the company. Since on LED datasheets there is only limited information provided, companies designing LED luminaires spend a lot of effort gathering the required input of LED details to be able to design reliable products. Small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) do not have the bandwidth to gather such input and solely rely on empirical approaches leading to approximated luminaire designs, while larger companies use advanced hardware and software tools to characterize parts, design versions, and finally optimize all design steps. In both cases, considerable time and money is spent on prototyping, sampling, and laboratory testing. Digitalization of the complete product development (also known as Industry 4.0 approach) at all integration levels of the solid state lighting (SSL) supply chain would provide the remedy for these pains. The Delphi4LED European project aimed at developing multi-domain compact models of LED (for a consistent, combined description of electronic, thermal, and optical properties of LEDs) as digital twins of the physical products to support virtual prototyping during the design of luminaires. This paper provides an overview of the Delphi4LED approach aimed at supporting new, completely digital workflows both for SMEs and larger companies (Majors) along with some comparison with the traditional luminaire design. Two demonstration experiments are described: One to show the achievable benefits of the approach and another one to demonstrate the ease of use and ability to be accommodated in a larger scale product design for assessing design choices like e.g., number and type of LEDs versus electrical/thermal conditions and constraints, in a tool agnostic manner.;0;2019;28

A linear static analysis was performed to investigate the instantaneous impacts of dead and wind loads on the complex concrete structure which was completed in 1973. A quasistatic analysis was performed to predict the effects of creep and shrinkage due to dead load on the structure in 2050 to discern its longevity. In 2050, the Sydney Opera House is expected to experience 0.090% element strain due to creep and shrinkage and therefore suffer prestress losses of 32.59 kN per strand. However, given that the current time after prestress loading is approximately 50 years, the majority of creep and shrinkage effects have already taken place with 0.088% strain and 32.12 kN of prestress losses. The analysis concludes that very minor structural impacts are expected over the next 30 years due to creep and shrinkage, suggesting a change in conservation focus from large structural concerns to inspection and maintenance of minor issues of surface cracking and water ingress. The analysis is the first step in the application of more complex finite element modelling of the structure with the integration of complex building information models. The main motivation to undertake the current numerical simulation is to determine a cost-effective solution when it comes to the long-term time-dependent analysis. The paper also will suggest future directions for monitoring unique historical buildings, including digital twin'.;0;2019;18

J;"Moreira, MV; Lesage, JJ";Discrete event system identification with the aim of fault detection;"Identification; Discrete-event systems; Fault detection; Automata";In this paper, we present a method for discrete event system identification with the aim of fault detection. The method is based on a new model called Deterministic Automaton with Outputs and Conditional Transitions (DAOCT), which is computed from observed fault-free paths, and represents the fault-free system behavior. In practice, a trade-off between size and accuracy of the identified automaton has to be found. In order to obtain compact models, loops are introduced in the model, which implies that sequences that are not observed can be generated by the model leading to an exceeding language. This exceeding language is associated with possible non-detectable faults, and must be reduced in order to use the model for fault detection. We show, in this paper, that the exceeding language generated by the DAOCT is smaller than the exceeding language generated by another model proposed in the literature, reducing, therefore, the number of possible non-detectable faults. We also show that if the identified DAOCT does not have cyclic paths, then the exceeding language is empty, and the model represents all and only all observed fault-free sequences generated by the system. In order to illustrate the results of the paper, a physical system is simulated by using a 3D simulation software controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The main idea is to use a virtual digital system to simulate the fault-free behavior of a physical system, captured by the sequences of input and output signals of the PLC, and then use the method proposed in the paper to obtain the DAOCT model of the plant.;0;2019;19

Design / Methodology / Approach: Two simulation environments were developed. The first one models the original operation without the collaborative robot. The second one evaluates the impact of inserting the robot. This work is quantitative. Results: The paper presents the use of digital manufacturing tools in a simulation of a collaborative operation between a human and a collaborative robot. The simulations with and without the collaborative robot were performed, and they make it possible to emphasize the benefits of the collaborative operation in a real production line. Limitations of the investigation: The first simulation scenario was validated from the real data provided by the factory. However, the second scenario is a suggestion, emphasizing the benefits of collaborative operation. Implementation of the second scenario was not conducted. Practical implications: Since its completion depended on support from the automotive sector, this work is noticeably practical. The real data used in the first scenario as well as the assumptions made in the second scenario allow one to conclude that it is possible to implement the propositions with the collaborative robot in the chosen line. Originality / Value: The use of the collaborative robot in Brazil was forbidden by regulation until recently. Even in other countries decision makers still find have difficulty deciding for this new technology. For this reason, the benefits of using collaborative robots, mainly in Brazilian companies, is still not clear. This work contributes to the collaborative robot discussion and consequently to Industry 4.0 implementation by creating a digital twin of an existing process and inserting a collaborative robot in it. The results should be used by decision makers to decide for inserting this technology in their factories.;0;2019;20

The research in this paper aimed to fill the gap that there is a lack of a feasible solution for cloud-based manufacturing equipment that can provide on-demand manufacturing services accessible via the Internet. The technical challenges in developing cloud-based manufacturing equipment and the enabling technologies are discussed. A generic system architecture for cloud-based manufacturing equipment based on cyber-physical production systems and big data analytics is proposed, allowing manufacturing equipment to be connected to the cloud and made available for the provision of on-demand manufacturing services.

J;"Petkovic, T; Puljiz, D; Markovic, I; Hein, B";Human intention estimation based on hidden Markov model motion validation for safe flexible robotized warehouses;"Human intention estimation; Hidden Markov model; Virtual reality; Theory of Mind";With the substantial growth of logistics businesses the need for larger warehouses and their automation arises, thus using robots as assistants to human workers is becoming a priority. In order to operate efficiently and safely, robot assistants or the supervising system should recognize human intentions in real-time. Theory of Mind (ToM) is an intuitive human conception of other humans' mental state, i.e., beliefs and desires, and how they cause behavior. In this paper we propose a ToM based human intention estimation algorithm for flexible robotized warehouses. We observe human's, i.e., worker's motion and validate it with respect to the goal locations using generalized Voronoi diagram based path planning. These observations are then processed by the proposed hidden Markov model framework which estimates worker intentions in an online manner, capable of handling changing environments. To test the proposed intention estimation we ran experiments in a real-world laboratory warehouse with a worker wearing Microsoft Hololens augmented reality glasses. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the approach to larger warehouses, we propose to use virtual reality digital warehouse twins in order to realistically simulate worker behavior. We conducted intention estimation experiments in the larger warehouse digital twin with up to 24 running robots. We demonstrate that the proposed framework estimates warehouse worker intentions precisely and in the end we discuss the experimental results.;0;2019;15

Yet, challenges arise in applying these new approaches in consumer goods industries that often emphasize mass production and extended supply chains. We build a conceptual framework to explore whether big data combined with new manufacturing technologies can facilitate redistributed manufacturing (RDM). Through analysis of 24 consumer goods industry cases using primary and secondary data, we investigated evolving manufacturing configurations, their underlying drivers, the role of big data applications, and their impact on the redistribution of manufacturing. We find some applications of RDM concepts, although in other cases existing manufacturing configurations are leveraged for high volume consumer goods products through big data analytics and market segmentation. The analysis indicates that the framework put forward in the paper has broader value in organizing thinking about emerging interrelationships between big data and manufacturing.;1;2019;14

This semi-active digital twin model is an attempt to link noninvasive video of a patient face to the percentage of carotid occlusion. The pulsatile nature of blood flow through the carotid arteries induces a subtle head vibration. This vibration is a potential indicator of carotid stenosis severity, and it is exploited in the present study. A head vibration model has been proposed in the present work that is linked to the forces generated by blood flow with or without occlusion. The model is used to generate a large number of virtual head vibration data for different degrees of occlusion. In order to determine the in vivo head vibration, a computer vision algorithm is adopted to use human face videos. The in vivo vibrations are compared against the virtual vibration data generated from the coupled computational blood flow/vibration model. A comparison of the in vivo vibration is made against the virtual data to find the best fit between in vivo and virtual data. The preliminary results on healthy subjects and a patient clearly indicate that the model is accurate and it possesses the potential for detecting approximate severity of carotid artery stenoses.;0;2019;17
J;"Caputo, F; Greco, A; Fera, M; Macchiaroli, R";Digital twins to enhance the integration of ergonomics in the workplace design;"Ergonomics; Digital twin; Managerial methodological framework; Simulation; Human-centered design";Recently, human-centered design has become one of the most promising approaches for improving the entire production process design. During the design phase, among the main important aspects to investigate, ergonomic performance of the workplace (WP) plays a key role. It is well known that design errors can lead to significant delays in the design and engineering of a production process, especially when it is related to a complex system such as the assembly line of an automotive industry. Prediction of the ergonomic performance, which is often coarsely considered during the design phase, can represent a fundamental step in preventing ergonomic issues since the early design phase of a production process, avoiding also negative consequences on line balancing. Based on a concurrent engineering (CE) approach, the aim of this paper is to present a framework that uses digital twins of stations in order to minimise the time necessary to develop and design a new assembly line. The application of this procedure will allow avoiding the possibility of realising a line that reveals ergonomic problems and correcting design errors during the design phase and not just during the production phase. In this way, it is possible to achieve great advantages in terms of cost avoidance for the correction of the design errors and in terms of time to market, which will be significantly reduced. A digital twin of a real station of a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) assembly line is presented to validate the numerical procedure and the design approach proposed in this paper. Finally, numerical results, regarding the evaluation of an ergonomic index, were compared with experimental ones achieved by analysing data collected during an experimental session.;4;2019;12

Numeric modelling data and experimental data about turbine blade geometry and structural/dynamical behaviour are combined to obtain an affordable digital twin model useful in reducing the undesirable uncertainties during the entire turbine lifecycle. Moreover, this model can be used to track and predict blade structural changes, due for example to structural damage, and to assess its remaining life. A new interactive and recursive process is proposed. It includes CAD geometry generation and finite element analyses, combined with experimental data gathered from the structural testing of a new generation wind turbine blade. The goal of the research is to show how the unique features of a complex wind turbine blade are considered in the virtual model updating process, fully exploiting the computational capabilities available to the designer in modern engineering. A composite Sandia National Laboratories Blade System Design Study (BSDS) turbine blade is used to exemplify the proposed process. Static, modal and fatigue experimental testing are conducted at Clarkson University Blade Test Facility. A digital model was created and updated to conform to all the information available from experimental testing. When an updated virtual digital model is available the performance of the blade during operation can be assessed with higher confidence.;0;2019;14

Intelligent manufacturing is characterised by autonomy and self-optimisation, which proposes new demands such as learning and cognitive capacities for manufacturing cell, known as the minimum implementation unit for intelligent manufacturing. Consequently, this paper proposes a general framework for knowledge-driven digital twin manufacturing cell (KDTMC) towards intelligent manufacturing, which could support autonomous manufacturing by an intelligent perceiving, simulating, understanding, predicting, optimising and controlling strategy. Three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analysed, which equip KDTMC with the capacities of self-thinking, self-decision-making, self-execution and self-improving. The implementing methods of KDTMC are also introduced by a thus constructed test bed. Three application examples about intelligent process planning, intelligent production scheduling and production process analysis and dynamic regulation demonstrate the feasibility of KDTMC, which provides a practical insight into the intelligent manufacturing paradigm.;2;;18

After presenting our motivation to adopt an open source approach for the design of a DT demonstrator, we identify the major implementation requirements of Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) and DTs. A conceptualisation of the core components of a DT demonstrator is provided and three technology building blocks for the realisation of a DT have been identified. These technology building blocks include components for the management of data, models and services. From the conceptual model of the DT demonstrator, we derived a high-level micro-services architecture and provided a case study infrastructure for the implementation of the DT demonstrator based on available open source technologies. The paper closes with research questions to be addressed in the future.;0;2019;19

Moreover, the range of regulations has increased and customer requirements have diversified. As a result, a new paradigm for the manufacturing environment is needed to improve competitiveness. As IT technology develops, we are making efforts to improve product design and production efficiency by combining various technologies such as digital twin, virtual reality and augmented reality. To use these technologies, 3D models of products are important. A product model exists in a 3D CAD system, which is required to utilize the model. The focus of previous research was on shape transformation using neutral formats such as igs and step files. However, this was also incomplete, and would be better visualized in virtual/augmented reality. In this study, we aimed to develop a framework to extract and visualize 3D models that could be used in augmented/virtual reality in real time and we conducted a test to verify the framework's validity and efficiency. As a result of the test, it is expected that this framework will be a valuable variety field in the lifecycles of a ship, an offshore structure, and an industrial plant.;0;2019;11
J;"Delbrugger, T; Rossmann, J";Representing adaptation options in experimentable digital twins of production systems;"Digital twins; model-based systems engineering; MBSE; modelling; capabilities; variability modelling; Virtual Testbeds";Simulations are powerful tools for decision support during factory adaptation processes. In order to provide the most valuable form of decision support, a tool must take into account the decision problem and relevant decision alternatives. Today's simulation tools, however, only accept simple notions of variability, like numeric parameter ranges. Thereby they ignore most of the variability of production systems, and do not utilise their full potential to aid decisions. To improve this situation, a new concept on how to systematically model the variability of production systems in Digital Twins of production entities is proposed. It combines Model-Based Systems Engineering and Variability Management to model different variants of production systems, and utilises capabilities of production equipment to make Digital Twins modular and reconfigurable. Each valid combination of variants results in a directly 3D-simulable Digital Twin for the whole production system, allowing automatic validation testing and fast feedback loops during system development. The presented concept is not only a very important basis for managing variants. As the variants model can be used as a search space for optimisation algorithms, the concept is an important stepping stone for a more powerful simulation-based optimisation of production systems.;0;2019;14

Connected micro smart factories in factory-as-a-service system with these new manufacturing paradigms and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are inefficient in terms of cost and production. To solve these problems, a digital twin, which uses a digital representation of a process, with the same configuration of manufacturing elements, synchronized information, and functional units, was designed and implemented. The digital twin utilizes the latest information from the Internet to gather data from IIoT devices and interoperates in a variety of applications. In addition, it derives the components of a detailed design of the digital twin application, to which it performs procedure definition. This research differs from other digital twin studies that concentrate on the prognostic health management of only a single machine. This study could help managers organize the benefits of utilization through a digital twin based on a hierarchy as they could receive real-time monitoring of the present, tracking information from the past, and operational decision-making support for the future. In addition, the proposed application reduces the cost and production inefficiencies, ultimately resulting in the efficient operation of a manufacturing system.;0;2019;19

This approach aims to establish a high-precision digital mirror of physical assembly system in the virtual environment, with which the assembly process in the virtual environment can be performed synchronously with that in the physical world. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a realistic geometrical representation model based on measured point cloud, as well as the multiple constraints modelling methods for local and global constraints with the proposed representation model. For the assembly target optimization, a novel optimization method based on the evaluation of multi-dimensional tolerance zone is proposed, where the particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithm are combined to calculate the optimal solutions. Findings As shown in the validation results, the minimum easiness value for easiness model in global optimization is 3.01, while the best value for weighting model by adjusting weights for more than 10 times is 1.94. The results verify that the proposed coordination modelling approach is effective to the assembly of multi-constrained objects, and the optimization model has an obvious advantage over the traditional weighting method. Originality/value This paper provides a new idea for the fine control of assembly quality of non-ideal components by introducing the measured data into the on-line assembly process. Besides, a novel optimization method based on the evaluation of multi-dimensional tolerance zone is proposed, which overcomes the problem of traditional weighting model wherein the weightings are difficult to determine.;0;2019;12
J;Neeraj, RS;Trade Rules for the Digital Economy: Charting New Waters at the WTO;;This Article attempts to explore the challenges in situating a multilateral digital trade agreement within the legal framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 1 of the article discusses the broad challenges that digitization poses for the international legal framework for trade regulation. I argue first that the traditional classification of products into goods and services under the WTO system is structurally incompatible with the digital economy. I also argue that striking the appropriate balance between trade liberalization and the pursuit of legitimate public policy objectives in a digital trade agreement will be uniquely challenging because certain features that are intrinsic to the digital industry and business strategies of established players in the digital market raise serious anticompetition challenges. A multilateral agreement regulating digital trade needs to acknowledge and address these challenges. Section 2 surveys the efforts that have been undertaken to regulate digital trade as manifested in the WTO Work Program on Electronic Commerce. Acknowledging that the digital trade agenda of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement could be used as a benchmark for discussions on e-commerce at the WTO, I argue that future negotiations for a multilateral digital trade policy will not benefit from using the TPP's digital trade agenda as a benchmark. The TPP does not reconcile systemic tensions between the digital economy and the extant WTO system or address the anticompetition challenges that are unique to the digital ecosystem.;0;2019;21

Development of CPMT requires standardized information modelling method and communication protocols for machine tools. This paper proposes a CPMT Platform based on OPC UA and MTConnect that enables standardized, interoperable and efficient data communication among machine tools and various types of software applications. First, a development method for OPC UA-based CPMT is proposed based on a generic OPC UA information model for CNC machine tools. Second, to address the issue of interoperability between OPC UA and MTConnect, an MTConnect to OPC UA interface is developed to transform MTConnect information model and its data to their OPC UA counterparts. An OPC UA-based CPMT prototype is developed and further integrated with a previously developed MTConnect-based CPMT to establish a common CPMT Platform. Third, different applications are developed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CPMT Platform, including an OPC UA Client, an advanced AR-assisted wearable Human-Machine Interface and a conceptual framework for CPMT powered cloud manufacturing environment. Experimental results have proven that the proposed CPMT Platform can significantly improve the overall production efficiency and effectiveness in the shop floor.;0;2019;14

In a matrix production system, flexible, configurable production and assembly cells are arranged in a grid layout, and the in-plant supply is based on autonomous vehicles. Adaptable and flexible material handling solutions are required to perform the dynamically changing supply-demands of standardized and categorized manufacturing and assembly cells. Within the frame of this paper, the authors describe the in-plant supply process of matrix production and the optimization potential in these processes. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces the structure of matrix production as a cyber-physical system focusing on logistics aspects. A mathematical model of this in-plant supply process is described including extended and real-time optimization from routing, assignment, and scheduling points of view. The optimization problem described in the model is an NP-hard problem. There are no known efficient analytical methods to find the best solution for this kind of problem; therefore, we use heuristics to find a suitable solution for the above-described problem. Next, a sequential black hole-floral pollination heuristic algorithm is described. The scenario analysis, which focuses on the clustering and routing aspects of supply demands in a matrix production system, validates the model and evaluates its performance to increase cost-efficiency and warrants environmental awareness of the in-plant supply in matrix production.";0;2019;33

The aim of this tool is to address to the three main issues affecting such decision: the cost of the information sharing, the scarce visibility of the client's data and the uncertainty of quantifying the return from investing into a WMS feature. Design/methodology/approach The tool behaves as a digital twin of a WMS. In addition, it incorporates a set of WMS's features based both on heuristics and optimization techniques and uses simulation to perform what-if multi-scenario analyses of alternative management scenarios. In order to validate the effectiveness of the tool, its application to a real-world 3PL warehouse operating in the sector of biomedical products is illustrated. Findings The results of a simulation campaign along an observation horizon of ten months demonstrate how the tool supports the comparison of alternative scenarios with the as-is, thereby suggesting the most suitable WMS customization to adopt. Practical implications - The tool supports 3PL managers in enhancing the efficiency of the operations and the fulfilling of the required service level, which is increasingly challenging given the large inventory mix and the variable clients portfolio that 3PLs have to manage. Particularly, the choice of the WMS customization that better perform with each business can be problematic, given the scarce information visibility of the provider on the client's processes. Originality/ value - To the author's knowledge, this paper is among the first to address a still uncovered gap of the warehousing literature by illustrating a DST that exploits optimization and simulation techniques to quantify the impacts of the information availability on the warehousing operations performance. As a second novel contribution, this tool enables to create a digital twin of a WMS and foresee the evolution of the warehouse's performance over time.;1;2019;23

Not only does the enhancement of process and systematic efficiency secure sustainability through increased energy efficiency but it also improves the efficiency in terms of overall productivity. Dyeing and finishing industries consume massive amounts of energy and have large energy-related expenditures.

J;"Liu, LL; Wan, X; Gao, ZG; Li, XL; Feng, BW";Research on modelling and optimization of hot rolling scheduling;"Digital twin; Hot rolling plan scheduling; Multi-objective constrained optimization; NSGA-II algorithm; MOPSO algorithm";Multiple species and random change in batch order forms has become the core business of Steel Intelligent Production Enterprises, necessitating new requirements for scheduling real-time adaptability and precision in the steel scheduling model. In this paper, a digital twin intelligent agent with cyberspace physical space integration is proposed as the unified driving source. First, an Open Multiple Objective Travelling Salesmen Problem model was established. For constraints such as a minimum rolling unit plan, process specification and a minimum power consumption per ton of steel, the NSGA-II algorithm was used to obtain a Pareto front for these constraints. With the help of appropriate penalty coefficients for the Pareto front, the constraints were defined as 3D-coordinates among cities of the Travelling Salesmen Problem. Combining the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the PSO algorithm was redefined and modified by introducing the metropolis criterion of the SA algorithm twice. This was used to obtain two extremes of the particle swarm, including the individual optimal solution and the global optimal solution to avoid local extrema. A model based on SA-MOPSO was thus obtained. Then, with the help of real-time mapping between the steel production line and the information model, the double-flow digital twin agent was established. This agent can achieve production scheduling model dynamic development and maturation itself. Finally, taking the steel hot rolling production line as a case in point, training and trial application of the model were performed to verify its adaptive development ability. Simulation results show that the algorithm discussed in this paper can solve the problem of hot rolling scheduling and provide support for decision-makers.;1;2019;16
J;"Mukherjee, T; Debroy, T";A digital twin for rapid qualification of 3D printed metallic components;"Additive manufacturing; Digital twin; Machine learning; Big data; Mechanistic model";The customized production of complex components by 3D printing has been hailed as a potentially trans formative tool in manufacturing with important applications in health care, automotive and aerospace industries. However, after about a quarter of a century of research and development, only a handful of commercial alloys can be printed and the market value of all 3D printed products now amounts to a negligible portion of the manufacturing economy. This difficulty is attributable to a remarkable diversity in structure and properties of the printed components and susceptibility to defects. In addition, the current practice of qualifying components by prolonged trial and error with expensive printing equipment and feed stock material confine the printed products to a niche market where the high product cost and the delay in the qualification are not critical factors. Here we explain how a digital twin or a digital replica of the printing machine will reduce the number of trial and error tests to obtain desired product attributes and reduce the time required for part qualification to make the printed components cost effective. It is shown that a comprehensive digital twin of 3D printing machine consisting of mechanistic, control and statistical models of 3D printing, machine learning and big data can reduce the volume of trial and error testing, reduce defects and shorten time between the design and production.

In particular, it addresses the need of fast and accurate simulators for the mechanical response at tissue and organ scale and the capability of integrating patient-specific anatomy from medical images to pinpoint the individual variations from standard anatomical models. Methods: We propose an automated procedure to create mechanical models of the human liver with patient-specific geometry and real time capabilities. The method hinges on the use of Statistical Shape Analysis to extract the relevant anatomical features from a database of medical images and Model Order Reduction to compute an explicit parametric solution for the mechanical response as a function of such features. The Sparse Subspace Learning, coupled with a Finite Element solver, was chosen to create low-rank solutions using a non-intrusive sparse sampling of the feature space. Results: In the application presented in the paper, the statistical shape model was trained on a database of 385 three dimensional liver shapes, extracted from medical images, in order to create a parametrized representation of the liver anatomy. This parametrization and an additional parameter describing the breathing motion in linear elasticity were then used as input in the reduced order model. Results show a consistent agreement with the high fidelity Finite Element models built from liver images that were excluded from the training dataset. However, we evidence in the discussion the difficulty of having compact shape parametrizations arising from the extreme variability of the shapes found in the dataset and we propose potential strategies to tackle this issue. Conclusions: A method to represent patient-specific real-time liver deformations during breathing is proposed in linear elasticity. Since the proposed method does not require any adaptation to the direct Finite Element solver used in the training phase, the procedure can be easily extended to more complex nonlinear constitutive behaviors - such as hyperelasticity - and more general load cases. Therefore it can be integrated with little intrusiveness to generic simulation software including more sophisticated and realistic models. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;1;2019;12

While the short goals of ICME are almost accomplished, those long goals are on the right way, highlighting the concept/strategy of materials by design. In this brief review, the recent frameworks of data-driven ICME in the last two years are discussed, presenting key aspects of principles, benchmarks, standards, databases, platforms and toolkits via various case studies. The author and his collaborators display a routine of data-driven ICME utilized in the investigations of Mg alloys through integrating the high-throughput first-principles calculations and the CALPHAD approach. It is highlighted that the bonding charge density could not only provide an atomic and electronic insight into the physical nature of chemical bond of pure elements, alloys, metal melts, oxides and semiconductors, surface and interfaces, but also reveal the fundamental solid-solution strengthening/embrittlement mechanism and the grain refinement mechanism, paving a path in accelerating the development of advanced materials.

However, there is a lack of studies that address the configurability and modularity of these systems, which is important for designing customized systems with customized devices. We propose a solution to solve this through a modular framework that automatically recognizes and configures new devices and provides real-time data wirelessly. The proposed framework creates a Digital Twin of the physical device and mirrors its attributes and sensory information into the cyber world so they can be used in real-time and post-routine analysis. As a proof of concept, a configurable CPS model for physical activities monitoring is designed and implemented. The designed gait monitoring and analysis system delivers spatiotemporal data from multiple multi-sensory devices to a central data handling and backup cloud server over conventional IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi. An experiment involving a young athlete examined whether or not the CPS components would recognize each other over foreign networks and communicate accurate information.;0;2019;17

This molecular variety causes a growing need for a general change of methods as well as mindset in the process development stage, as there are no platform processes available such as those for monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, market competitiveness demands hyper-intensified processes, including accelerated decisions toward batch or continuous operation of dedicated modular plant concepts. This indicates gaps in process comprehension, when operation windows need to be run at the edges of optimization. In this editorial, the authors review and assess potential methods and begin discussing possible solutions throughout the workflow, from process development through piloting to manufacturing operation from their point of view and experience. Especially, the state-of-the-art for modeling in red biotechnology is assessed, clarifying differences and applications of statistical, rigorous physical-chemical based models as well as cost modeling. ""Digital-twins"" are described and efforts vs. benefits for new applications exemplified, including the regulation-demanded QbD (quality by design) and PAT (process analytical technology) approaches towards digitalization or industry 4.0 based on advanced process control strategies. Finally, an analysis of the obstacles and possible solutions for any successful and efficient industrialization of innovative methods from process development, through piloting to manufacturing, results in some recommendations. A central question therefore requires attention: Considering that QbD and PAT have been required by authorities since 2004, can any biologic manufacturing process be approved by the regulatory agencies without being modeled by a ""digital-twin"" as part of the filing documentation?";5;2019;28

Big data-based reusing and evaluating the multi-dimensional process knowledge is widely accepted as an effective strategy for improving competitiveness of enterprises. However, there was little research on how to reuse and evaluate process knowledge with dynamical changing machining status. In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin-based approach for reusing and evaluating process knowledge. First, the digital twin-based process knowledge model which contains the geometric information and real-time process equipment status is introduced to represent the purpose and requirement of machining planning. Second, the process big data is constructed based on the three-layer and its association rules for accumulating process knowledge. Moreover, the similarity calculation algorithm of the scene model is proposed to filter the unmatched process knowledge. For accurately reusing the process knowledge, the process reusability evaluation approach of the candidate knowledge set is presented based on the real-time machining status and the calculated confidence. Finally, the diesel engine parts are applied in the developed prototype module to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method can promote the development and application of the smart process planning.;4;2019;16

Wherever humans and industrial robots share a common workplace, accidents are likely to happen and always unpredictable. This has hindered the development of human robot collaborative strategies as well as the ability of authorities to pass regulations on how humans and robots should work together in close proximities.

The reasons include: 1) the specification is often unclear, ambiguous and incomplete resulting in misunderstandings and undesired behavior. 2) It is almost impossible for a human to reason about the correctness of a system consisting of thousands of components. 3) It is very hard to observe all related components when trying to solve a problem because the system is geographically distributed over large areas.

S;"Uzun, M; Demirezen, MU; Koyuncu, E; Inalhan, G";Design of a Hybrid Digital-twin Flight Performance Model through Machine Learning;;"This study implements deep learning techniques to estimate fuel burn of a jet aircraft. Current ground-based flight planning systems utilize aircraft type specific performance tables to determine fuel flows for given flight conditions and parameters such as altitude, mass and speed. These tables are corrected by a performance factor as the aircraft ages. Despite this update, planned fuel consumption may indeed not overlap with the actual one. In order to synchronize the base aircraft model with aircraft's actual performance, we propose using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for building data-driven models of fuel flows. Towards this goal, aircraft's on-board recorded trajectory and parameter data, namely Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data are utilized. The total dataset used within this study comprises of more than 1000 B777-300ER flights from a major European flag carrier airline. The deep neural network architecture is utilized for modeling the actual fuel flow specific to each aircraft and for each major flight mode (climb, cruise and descent namely). We have developed three neural network architectures (according to in-flight and ground based planning use cases) to present a tail-number specific correction factor to Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. First architecture involves a QAR data based black-box fuel flow model utilizing in-flight throttle data from all the engines. Comparison of this model with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean errors lower than %0:1 can be achieved. The second architecture utilizes a physically consistent data regeneration of ffiT (delta thrust) using BADA formulation as to account for the ground planning phase where throttle information is not available. The third model involves a cascaded architecture which utilizes a neural network throttle estimator and the blackbox QAR fuel flow model for again the ground planning phase. Comparison of the latter models with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean absolute errors lower than %0:7 can be achieved at all the flight modes. Initial tests reflect the fact that even better accuracy can be achieved for all models as the data set size increases. Finally, ground based planning fuel flow models are applied to actual flight plans generated by ground based systems. Total trip fuel comparisons show discrepancies up to %3:5 total fuel loading weight, which may result in potential fuel savings by decreasing the fuel load during take-off. Comparison of the planned and the estimated fuel boarding weights (following the actual filed flight plans) for 91 long-haul flights show that fuel burn savings of around 800[kg] per flight could have been achieved by the proposed methodology at the ground planning phase. For a typical operation of 100 long-haul flights per day, this represents yearly savings on the order of around 17 million USD at current jet fuel prices. This tail-number specific"" performance modeling approach is projected to open considerable frontiers including the in-flight update of performance models through machine learning methods.";0;2019;14

A predictive maintenance method for shearer key parts based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of monitoring data is proposed. Firstly, a high-fidelity model and hyper-realistic behavior simulations of the shearer key parts are implemented based on offline monitored data and online monitoring data, the obtained position, posture, trajectory and other information can be used for qualitative analysis. Subsequently, an autoencoder (AE) combined with a deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit (bi-GRU) prediction model is constructed to predict the RUL based on online monitoring data for quantitative analysis. The adjusted_R-2 value obtained for the deep bi-GRU model was 0.9916, determined in a model-accuracy verification test. Finally, taking the rocker arm of shearer as an example, its working status is visualized using digital mirror from physical space to virtual space, and then its RUL is predicted based on the AE bi-GRU prediction model. The decision-making that guides predictive maintenance can be obtained based on the synthesis of qualitative and quantitative analysis. The application test results demonstrate that the proposed method can be effective for improving the intelligence of predictive process and the accuracy of predictive results.;0;2019;19

For well over a decade now, a frequency domain mode filtering based measurement technique has been utilized to significantly reduce range reflections within antenna test systems [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. More recently however, this technique has been adapted so that it could also be used with far-field and compact antenna measurement systems [9, 10, 1] with the technique being firmly rooted in conventional cylindrical near-field theory [1]. Although this family of techniques was initially intended to provide a means by which the lower frequency limit of operation of a given facility [3, 4] could be extended downwards to work effectively in applications where the operation would otherwise be impaired by the fixed physical size of the absorber and therefore predetermined electrical performance, these techniques have more recently been used very successfully to improve performance at the upper end of the frequency extent [11]. Although this technique has been extensively examined and verified empirically by means of range measurements, relatively little verification by means of computational electromagnetic simulation is available in the open literature [1, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In this paper, we developed an efficient computational electromagnetic (CEM) model of the measurement configuration, i.e. a digital twin, using a three-dimensional, full-wave CEM solver. The purpose of this is to construct an absolute truth-model to provide a firm basis for a detailed quantitative examination of the scattering suppression technique. The modelling technique is discussed in detail and initial results are presented which show very good agreement between the ""true"" far-field pattern of the antenna in free space and that of the far-field of the antenna when perturbed with the presence of a scatterer and applying the scattering suppression process.";0;2019;5
S;"Mayes, A; Heffernan, J; Jauriqui, L; Livings, R; Biedermann, E; Aldrin, JC; Goodlet, BR; Mazdiyasni, S";Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT) Inversion for Material Characterization and Digital Twin Calibration;;The Digital Twin paradigm is based on the idea that a component's serviceable life and performance can be better predicted and monitored by creating a faithful virtual counterpart of a real component, which in turn leads to improvements in end-product safety and cost. Such a model requires accurate inputs for the initial material state of the part as well as in-service loads and damage states throughout its service life. The resonance frequencies of a part correlate to a part's material state and damage state. Similarly, changes in resonance frequencies correlate to changes in the part's material state resulting from in-service loads and damage. Process Compensated Resonance Testing (PCRT) leverages these physical relationships to perform nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and material characterization using the measured resonance frequencies of a component. Prior work has established techniques for modeling the effects of material property variation, crystal orientation, and damage states on resonance, as well as quantifying uncertainty propagation from model inputs to outputs. This study examines the use of PCRT model inversion to obtain material properties and calibrate digital twins of real components. Digital twin instances were first created for a population of single crystal Nickel-base superalloy samples using dimension and mass measurements. Then. atter collecting resonance spectra from the physical counterparts, model inversion techniques were employed to estimate elastic properties and crystal orientation for each part. The digital twins were then calibrated with the model inversion output. These digital twins were subsequently validated by comparing the inversion results to resonance and x-ray diffraction measurements on a statistically significant population of physical specimens. The results highlight the value of part-specific material properties for digital twin performance, as well as the ability of PCRT to evaluate and improve digital twin fidelity.;0;2019;10
J;"Guerra, RH; Quiza, R; Villalonga, A; Arenas, J; Castano, F";Digital Twin-Based Optimization for Ultraprecision Motion Systems With Backlash and Friction;"Digital twin; ultraprecision motion system; friction; backlash; optimization; cascade control";A digital twin-based optimization procedure is presented for an ultraprecision motion system with a flexible shaft connecting the motor to the (elastic) load, which is subject to both backlash and friction. The main contributions of the study are the design of the digital twin and its implementation, assuming a two-mass drive system. The procedure includes the virtual representation of mechanical and electrical components, non-linearities (backlash and friction), and the corresponding control system. A procedure for digital twin-based optimization is also presented, in which the maximum absolute position error is minimized while maintaining accuracy with no significant increase in the control effort. The optimal settings for the controller parameters and for the backlash peak amplitude, the backlash peak time, and the hysteresis amplitude are then determined, in order to guarantee an appropriate dynamic response in the presence of backlash and friction. The surface quality of certain manufactured components, such as hip and knee implants, depends on the smoothness and the accuracy of the real trajectory produced in the cutting process that is strongly influenced by the maximum position error. The simulations and experimental studies are presented using a real platform and two references for trajectory control, and a comparison of four digital twin-based optimization methods. The simulation study and the real-time experiments demonstrate the suitability of the digital twin-based optimization procedure and lay the foundations for the implementation of the proposed method at an industrial level.;0;2019;11

S;"Haag, S; Simon, C";SIMULATION OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL INTEGRATION IN DIGITAL TWINS;"Horizontal and Vertical Integration; IoT; Cyber-physical System; Digital Twin; Simulation; Petri nets";Horizontal integration describes the linkage of processes to simplify the flow of materials and information between different corporations. Vertical integration describes the connection or merging of processes between top and shop floors inside the very same organization to enable comprehensive possibilities for optimization, allowing virtually as side effect for the customized production of batch size one orders. Both fields offer interesting issues, for example how to gain insight into what kind of effects a possible transformation could have prior to conducting said transformation - maybe assembly of a new production line, reengineering of a supply chain or managing the change of a business process due to new market constraints. Alterations naturally come at a price, thus, testing the consequences by implementation is nearly always infeasible. To lessen the cost of change, transformations can be analyzed using digital twins - by modelling real world machinery, work pieces and processes, then simulating them and their interaction. The authors present a possibility to implement digital twins in arbitrary magnitude and level of detail. A web based specification and simulation environment allows for modelling both high-level business processes and field level as well as activities across companies' borders, comprising everything between.;0;2019;6

J;"Qi, QL; Tao, F";A Smart Manufacturing Service System Based on Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloud Computing;"Cloud computing; digital twin; edge computing; fog computing; hierarchical architecture; smart manufacturing";The state-of-the-art technologies in new generation information technologies (New IT) greatly stimulate the development of smart manufacturing. In a smart manufacturing environment, more and more devices would be connected to the Internet so that a large volume of data can be obtained during all phases of the product lifecycle. Cloud-based smart manufacturing paradigm facilitates a new variety of applications and services to analyze a large volume of data and enable large-scale manufacturing collaboration. However, different factors, such as the network unavailability, overfull bandwidth, and latency time, restrict its availability for high-speed and low-latency real-time applications. Fog computing and edge computing extended the compute, storage, and networking capabilities of the cloud to the edge, which will respond to the above-mentioned issues. Based on cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing, in this paper, a hierarchy reference architecture is introduced for smart manufacturing.

This paper presents design, analysis and experimental validation of online fault remediation strategies in those PV systems. The remediation analysis and design depend not only on a fault type but also on the power conversion architecture of a PV system. The remediation for common failure modes in a typical PV power conversion architecture is proposed. The remediation strategies include minimum additional hardware (e.g. a bypass power semiconductor switch) for power converter switch failures and soft sensors (i.e. digital twin estimators) for electrical sensor failures. To validate these strategies, a laboratory prototype of a 300 W fault-tolerant dc-dc buck-boost converter is built. The converter has a fault-tolerant power stage and it hosts fault diagnosis, prognosis, and reconfigurable control on an FPGA device. The experimental results show significant increase in system output power (thus dependability) after proposed fault remediation is applied amid faulted scenarios such as switch and sensor faults in a distributed power converter.;0;2019;8

CPS are concerned with the collaborative and interactive activities between cyber and physical components through sensing and actuation. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1451, a family of smart transducer interface standards, defines a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for smart transducers (sensors or actuators) to achieve sensor data interoperability between cyber and physical components of CPS. The IEEE 1516 high-level architecture (HLA) is a standard for the modeling and simulation of distributed, heterogeneous processes. CPS experimentation often requires the integration of different domain-specific simulation tools into a common platform using a method called co-simulation. In order to facilitate a wide range of CPS simulations and experiments, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a universal CPS environment for federation (UCEF), which is a toolset for designing and implementing federated, collaborative, and interactive experiments for CPS using HLA. This paper introduces an IEEE 1451 smart sensor digital twin federation, which has been developed using UCEF. The digital twin is a digital simulator or digital replica of a real IEEE 1451 smart sensor. The digital twin emulates both desired, non-linear behaviors and failure modes to simulate a real sensor in the field. This federation consists of three federates: an IEEE 1451 smart sensor digital twin federate (DTF), an IEEE 1451 digital twin tester federate (DTTF), and a federation experiment manager. In this federation, the DTTF can communicate with the DTF via HLA interactions that represent IEEE P1451.1 request and response messages. One federated experiment using three instances of IEEE 1451 digital twins is described in detail and the experimental results are provided in this paper. This federation provides a foundation for CPS research and experiments in the NIST CPS testbed.;0;2019;6

The present research study first proposes an Industrial Internet pyramid as emergent human-centric manufacturing paradigm within Industry 4.0 in which central is the role of a Ubiquitous Knowledge about the manufacturing system intuitively accessed and used by the manufacturing employees. Second, the prototype of a Service-oriented Digital Twin, which leverage on a flexible ontology-oriented knowledge structure and on augmented reality combined to a vocal interaction system for an intuitive knowledge retrieval and fruition, has been designed and developed to deliver this manufacturing knowledge. Two test-beds, complimentary for the problems in practice (the former on the maintenance-production interface in a large enterprise, the latter majorly focused in production and setups in a small and medium enterprise), show the significant benefits in terms of time, costs and process quality, thus validating the approach proposed.

The number of sensors available to measure loads during flights is limited. Complementary simulations are necessary to compute all the loads that the mechanical parts undergo. A new process is described to build these simulations fed with flights data records.

Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.;0;2019;12

For each new process / module / change in the manufacturing flow, there is a need for another customized training stage. For demanding industries (automotive, toys factories, household appliances, etc.) where customization is the key to sell more products, the time spent for preparing, designing and training people for new scenarios represents an important parameter that influences the production cycle efficiency. The current paper presents a solution to improve the measured performance on a new custom given task added to an existing scenario, using a multi-stage virtual reality (VR) simulator. The simulator acts as a digital twin for a physical testbed that offers 20+ parts to build the end product. To prove the performance of the solution, the first experiment uses a realistic multi-layered toy car as the end product. Both activities (real and virtual) are favoring the exploration of the building process, allowing the user (trainee) to discover multiple solutions that should lead to the same final result. The course of actions is supervised by an adaptive AI algorithm that compares the progress made by previous attempts (successful or not) with the ongoing attempt of a user and offers real-time guidance. Aside from using a gamified lego-like experience, the described approach contributes to the training process by offering personalized contextual suggestions, advices and tips.

Data and information are generated at every stage of this process and stored in software tools used to generate that data. For large scale manufacturing systems this leads to manual work, which is error-prone. This issue intensifies due to increasing influence of computer science on those systems (e.g. Industrie 4.0), leading to a rise of complexity. New approaches are needed for a better information flow.

However, the evolution of residual stress distribution throughout the shipbuilding process is not well understood. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) techniques enable linking disparate software codes across multiple length scales, thereby facilitating simulation of the entire material lifecycle - from material processing to fabrication to structural performance. This project is pairing computational simulation with physical measurement for verification and validation (V&V) of the linked finite-element analysis (FEA) tools. The linked FEA tools enable simulation of representative marine structures. Concurrently, the residual stress in an analogous physical structure will be measured through each step of the fabrication process: incoming plate, edge-prep, fit-up, welded assembly, and post-fatigue testing. The effort will follow specific areas within the component to understand the effects of fabrication and testing on residual stress magnitude and distribution. This fabrication-cycle material information is essential to understand the initial state of marine structures as the industry moves towards a digital twin prototype standard.

Fundamental exploration of algorithms and approaches to link, compare, and fuse numerical models used in digital twins with real-world sensor data is still needed for ship performance prediction, condition assessment, and ultimately, significant implementation of digital twin technology in the marine industry. In this work, a preliminary digital twin framework for surface ships has been developed to yield time-and-place specific predictions of vessel motions and structural responses given weather forecast or hindcast data for a selected route. Cumulative fatigue damage was predicted and compared for four simulated routes in the Pacific Ocean, and the predicted motions for the simulation with the greatest fatigue damage were analyzed to investigate the possible causes of this increased damage. The notable increase in cumulative damage seen for this route stresses the importance of the ability to track and balance fatigue damage among ships in a fleet. Moreover, this information would further support educated maintenance and deployment scheduling decisions to ensure fatigue damage equality among ships in a fleet, while real-time implementation of this digital twin technology would furnish operators with a greater understanding of a weather forecast's implications, and thereby provide in-mission decision support.;0;2019;8

The collaborative factory design approach is enabled by embedding the use of discrete event simulation connected with physical objects placed on a Digital Twin Module (DTM). The users can manipulate the physical objects as physical counterparts to the machines and equipment in the virtual space and visualize the designed factory and make further analysis. The method combines the use of dynamic discrete event simulation seamlessly connected with physical objects placed on the DTM to enable collaborative design. The bridging between simulation and physical objects is done by using a digital integration platform. Using physical artifacts as counterparts of the virtual objects in the simulation, participants confidently interact with the simulation regardless level of skills and competencies. The Smart Learning Factory is helping SMEs to get inspired using physical and virtual simulations for factory design and re-design, and develop solutions in a collaborative environment.

Tolerance of the countersunk hole's angle and depth could be allocated by the Digital Twin of the bolted CFRP-Metal bolt joint. The paper presents a simulation-based Digital Twin for tolerance allocation of CFRP-Metal countersunk bolt joint, mainly considering the strength of the single bolt countersunk joint. Using the design-of-experiment method, nine numerical models with different hole's angle and depth are constructed to simulate the countersunk holes with different deviations. Simulation results are input into the Digital Twin of the CFRP-Metal countersunk bolt joint. Analysis of variation (ANOVA) method is employed to deeply investigate the interaction between the angle deviation and the depth deviation under tensile loading. Tolerance of the countersunk hole is allocated based on the proposed Digital Twin involving simulation information.

After the sensor data are incorporated, updated systems specification and reliability models resulted in a new ranking. We will discuss the results of the rankings. Current research in developing the Digital Twin and Digital Thread are lacking in the area of logistics modeling. The incorporation of Discrete Event Simulation models to simulate transportation, handling, and storage shows promise to address these shortcomings.

J;Ullah, AMMS;Modeling and simulation of complex manufacturing phenomena using sensor signals from the perspective of Industry 4.0;"Industry 4.0; Semantic web; Cyber-physical systems; Meta-models; Webized phenomenon twin";This article presents a methodology defined as semantic modeling to create computable virtual abstractions of complex manufacturing phenomena denoted as phenomena twins from the perspective of the fourth industrial revolution (also known as Smart Manufacturing, Connected Factory, Industry 4.0, and so forth). The twins are created such that they become friendly to both sensor signals and new-generation web technology (i.e., the semantic web). The efficacy of the proposed modeling approach is demonstrated by creating a phenomenon twin of cutting force (a highly complex and stochastic phenomenon associated with all material removal processes) and also by representing it using the semantic web. The relevant epistemological and systemological issues (e.g., those of meta-models, ontology, classification/trustworthiness/provenance of knowledge associated with the webized phenomenon twin) are also discussed. This article will help developers of embedded (e.g., cyber-physical) systems needed for functionalizing Industry 4.0.;2;2019;13
J;"Schneider, GF; Wicaksono, H; Ovtcharova, J";Virtual engineering of cyber-physical automation systems: The case of control logic;"Control logic; Cyber-physical systems; Ontology; Industrial automation; Virtual engineering";Mastering the fusion of information and communication technologies with physical systems to cyber-physical automation systems is of main concern to engineers in the industrial automation domain. The engineering of these systems is challenging as their distributed nature and the heterogeneity of stakeholders and tools involved in their engineering contradict the need for the simultaneous engineering of their cyber and physical parts over their life cycle. This paper presents a novel approach based on the virtual engineering method, which provides support for the simultaneous engineering of the cyber and physical parts of automation systems. The approach extends and integrates the life cycle centered view mandated by current conceptual architectures and the digital twin paradigm with an integrated, iterative engineering method. The benefits of the approach are highlighted in a case study related to the engineering of the control logic of a cyber physical automation system originating from the process engineering domain. We describe for the first time a modular domain ontology, which formally describes the cyber and physical part of the system. We present cyber services built on top of the ontology layer, which allow to automatically verify different control logic types and simultaneously verify cyber and physical parts of the system in an incremental manner.;0;2019;17

J;"Laaki, H; Miche, Y; Tammi, K";Prototyping a Digital Twin for Real Time Remote Control Over Mobile Networks: Application of Remote Surgery;"Digital twin; virtual reality; robot control; mobile networks; network security";"The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.";1;2019;12
J;"Xu, Y; Sun, YM; Liu, XL; Zheng, YH";A Digital-Twin-Assisted Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning;"Digital twin; deep transfer learning; fault diagnosis; smart manufacturing";Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.;1;2019;10

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of ""new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for ""existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings.

Using CAD software, we ran virtual trials using the robot's digital twin in place of physical robot trials. When performing the task, the robot measures and sends the value of the weight to an IoT controller implemented on the ThingWorx platform and receives parameters of the optimal posture found through the virtual trials. When we presented the robot learning process to high school students they had difficulty fully understanding the robot's dynamics and selection of posture parameters.

Smart product-service systems (PSS). Smart PSS, as a unique type of PSS, aims to achieve individual customer satisfaction with less environment impact by utilizing SCP as the media and tool, to generate various e-services as a bundle. Its service innovation is enabled by a platform-based approach and generated in a data-driven manner. Moreover, the digitalization of users, things, manufacturers and service providers in the cloud-based environment also provides potential service innovation opportunities. Nevertheless, only few existing works discuss about the Smart PSS, let alone an effective manner with valid cases to support its service innovation. Aiming to fill this gap, this research provides a novel definition of Smart PSS, and proposes a systematic design framework for its service innovation with an elaborated case study of a personalized smart wearable.

J;"Groen, M; Zijlstra, G; San-Martin, D; Post, J; De Hosson, JTM";Product shape change by internal stresses;"Shape change; Residual stress; Phase transformation; Metal forming; Digital twin; FlexMM";The design of a product component may require complex processing steps such as metal forming followed by a thermal treatment. The thermal treatment may improve the functional performance of the material itself, but may result in rather unwanted changes in the shape of the product. Here it is shown that Finite Element modeling of the various processes can assist in the design of a robust and accurate production process. The modeling approach presented allows a coupling between various complex material models, in such a way that full cold forming and thermal treatment processes are calculated. This coupling of material models is key for the design and concerns the novelty of the proposed approach. Cold forming by deep drawing is calculated whereby planar anisotropy is implemented. The thermal hardening treatment consists of three contributions: creep, thermal expansion and phase transformation. All models are based on experimental data, acquired from tensile and dilatometer tests, and are implemented into the material model either directly or by a simple fit. It is shown that the effects of a complete forming and heat treatment of a cup could be successfully calculated. The predicted cup shape change was compared to experiments, and shows excellent agreement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;1;2018;9

J;"He, Y; Guo, JC; Zheng, XL";From Surveillance to Digital Twin Challenges and recent advances of signal processing for the industrial Internet of Things;;With the recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), the significance of information technologies to modern industry is upgraded from purely providing surveillance-centric functions to building a comprehensive information framework of the industrial processes. Innovative techniques and concepts emerge under such circumstances, e.g., digital twin, which essentially involves data acquisition, human-machine-product interconnection, knowledge discovery and generation, and intelligent control, etc. Signal processing techniques are crucial to the aforementioned procedures but face unprecedented challenges when they are applied in the complex industrial environments. In this article, we survey the promising industrial applications of IoT technologies and discuss the challenges and recent advances in this area. We also share our early experience with Pavatar, a real-world industrial IoT system that enables comprehensive surveillance and remote diagnosis for ultrahigh-voltage converter station (UHVCS).

J;"Guo, FY; Zou, F; Liu, JH; Wang, ZQ";Working mode in aircraft manufacturing based on digital coordination model;"Aircraft assembly; Manufacturing mode; Digital coordination model; Consistency of accumulated assembly errors; Wing flap component";As a key and core technology in aircraft manufacturing industry, assembly coordination technology is important to improve the competitiveness and manufacturing level. To get accurate dimensional size/shape/spatial position and coordination accuracy, according to characteristics of the working mode based on hard master tooling, working mode based on digital coordination model (DCM) is developed. Firstly, with the idea of digital twin, by analyzing the controlling method for coordination accuracy. a principle of the working mode based on DCM is proposed. The defined DCM is a process model that mirrors a practical assembly site, which consists of coordination element (CE), coordination relationship (CR), and control method for coordination accuracy (CMCA). It can replace hard master tooling as the only basis for the transfer process of dimension/shape/position in aircraft manufacturing. Secondly, the principle and detailed function process based on DCM in the whole aircraft manufacturing stage are presented. It is shown that the foundation of this mode is DCM, the focus of this mode is error transfer process in assembly, the direct analysis basis of this mode is measuring data, the core factor of this mode is dynamic feedback adjustment, and the ultimate goal is to control the consistency of accumulated error between assemblies. In contrast with the working mode based on hard master tooling, under the measuring field and virtual simulation/analysis environment, the function process of this mode is a dynamic closed loop comprising CEs/CRs that can be adjusted continually in real time with CMCA. Lastly, flexible assembling of four wing flap components is verified. Benefit results showed that the propagation of dimension/shape/position for products and flexible tooling can be completed under the working mode based on DCM. Furthermore, assembly accuracy and coordination accuracy can fit design requirements well, and the assembly efficiency with this new working mode is increased about 40%.;1;2018;25

The Industry 4.0 technological field is not new but it is highly heterogeneous (actually it is the aggregation point of more than 30 different fields of the technology). For this reason, many stakeholders feel uncomfortable since they do not master the whole set of technologies, they manifested a lack of knowledge and problems of communication with other domains. Actually such problem is twofold, on one side a common vocabulary that helps domain experts to have a mutual understanding is missing Riel et al. [1], on the other side, an overall standardization effort would be beneficial to integrate existing terminologies in a reference architecture for the Industry 4.0 paradigm Smit et al. [2]. One of the basics for solving this issue is the creation of shared semantic for industry 4.0.

The fourth industrial revolution, which was made possible by the availability of low cost sensors and connections, goes together with a more and more pervading employment of data and information, computational science and data analysis, new materials, machines, automated digitalized and connected systems and components. The 4.0 transformation allows to manage real networks which include, integrate and put in communication manufacturing machines, plants and structures, logistics and storage, distribution channels. One of the most undeniable advantages of the fourth industrial revolution is the higher safety level reached through a better man-machine interaction and interfacing. Thus, allowing a meaningful reduction in errors and accidents as well as an improvement of safety and ergonomics in the working place. The employment of production systems, which support and assist workers with their tasks, reduces work related stress and helps the overcome of some limits related to trained human resources availability, work force ageing, integration of workers with disability and such. From this perspective, the government developed the 4.0 Industrial National Plan which includes specific regulations to support the transformation process of the Italian industries who wish to embrace the opportunities offered by the fourth industrial revolution. These industries can benefit of specific supports, such as man-machine interaction systems to improve both ergonomics and work safety. The article shows some of the advantages in terms of work health and safety and the relevant opportunities to benefit of economical supports; it also includes some examples of ongoing projects.";0;2018;6

Many countries are competing to innovate their manufacturing chains for eco-friendly and energy-efficient productions. Although this green or sustainable manufacturing system evolves under the support of cyber-physical system (or digital twin) based on ICT technology, industrial robots also play important roles in this speedy, flexible and effective manufacturing chains. Recently, low-cost industrial robots or collaborative robots, are rising in a highly interactive environment with humans. Although an industrial robot consists of many important components such as mechanical parts (kinematic structure and reducer) and electric parts (servo motor, driver, sensors, and controller), precision reducer takes approximately 25% of material-cost and governs important performance indices of industrial robots. This paper presents review of high precision reducers (HPRs) for industrial robots driving 4th industrial revolution. First, we provide HPRs market along with industrial robots. According to previous studies, HPRs for industrial robots can be classified based on their principles: planetary reducer, cycloid reducer, and harmonic drive (HD). Then, principle, characteristics, and three main performances (hysteresis, rotational transmission error (RTE) and efficiency) of HPRs are discussed. In addition, compensation methods overcoming accuracy limits of HPRs are summarized. Finally, other applications of HPRs except industrial robots are presented.";6;2018;15

In consequence, RFID plays a fundamental role in the so-called digital factory or 4.0 Industry, aiming to increase the level of automatization of industrial processes. In addition, RFID has also been found to be of great help in improving the tracking of patients, medicines, and medical assets in hospitals, where the digitalization of these operations improves their efficiency and safety. This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art of RFID for e-Health applications, describing the contributions to improve medical services and discussing the limitations. In particular, it has been found that a lot of effort has been put into software development, but in most of the cases a detailed study of the physical layer (that is, the characterization of the RFID signals within the area where the system is deployed) is not properly conducted. This contribution describes a basic RFID system for tracking and managing assets in hospitals, aiming to provide additional details about implementation aspects that must be considered to ensure proper functionality of the system. Although the scope of the RFID system described in this contribution is restricted to a small area of the hospital, the architecture is fully scalable to cover the needs of the different medical services in the hospital. Ultra high-frequency (UHF) RFID technology is selected over the most extended near-field communication (NFC) and high-frequency (HF) RFID technology to minimize hardware infrastructure. In particular, UHF RFID also makes the coverage/reading area conformation easier by using different kinds of antennas. Information is stored in a database, which is accessed from end-user mobile devices (tablets, smartphones) where the position and status of the assets to be tracked are displayed.;2;2018;17

In the rocket and space technology, a dynamic finite element model represents the important component of the digital twin. This model is required to be capable of predicting behavior of the structure under dynamic load with a reliable accuracy. At the same time, calculations of the design response with allowance for amplitude- dependent damping are impossible by the modern finite element software. This article presents the test results of flat aluminum alloy samples which are the time characteristics of free damped oscillations and amplitude- frequency characteristics of forced oscillations of samples. An analysis of test results was carried out using the existing methods for obtaining dependences of the dumping on the equivalent (von Mises) stress in the material. The paper describes a damping matrix formation for numerical calculations using constant damping coefficients. Also, the article proposes an iterative algorithm, which enables the application of amplitude- dependent damping coefficients in the harmonic analysis.;0;2018;13
J;"Boulila, A; Ayadi, M; Mrabet, K";Ergonomics study and analysis of workstations in Tunisian mechanical manufacturing;"CATIA software; digital factory; ergonomics; human safety; normalized score RULA and REBA";The workers' performance in the mechanical manufacturing sector is the main factor for the improvement of productivity and quality. At present, it seems that the available information on the ergonomics and the working environment of the mechanical manufacturing actors is scarce. This study deals with the relationship between the working method and the workstation in injection mold manufacturing. An original methodology, based on the survey of operators using participatory ergonomic tools, is proposed in order to evaluate the ergonomic performance of 3 workstations: milling, turning, and drilling. The surveys concerned 3 operators. Obtained results showed that ergonomics play a key role in improving mechanical manufacturing. The results obtained from the analysis showed that ergonomics has a key role in the quality of the various tasks performed by operators. Using the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) investigation tools, the examination of the workstations revealed 4 machining operations and 12 operator postures that have a direct influence on the performance of all machining stations. In addition, data from the analysis conducted on injection mold manufacturing revealed that neither the workstations were ergonomic nor the operators complied with the ergonomic rules. Based on the results obtained, a new standardized score is proposed for the RULA and REBA calculations. This score was applied and validated through another study conducted in a leaf spring manufacturing plant. The results of these studies were concretized by proposing the digital factory where CATIA software was used for the virtual design of the ergonomic workstations and their environments.;1;2018;20

In current cyber-physical systems, data are collected from pieces of manufacturing equipment and used to drive useful change and affect production output. The data gathered typically describe the operating state of the equipment, such as a machine tool, and can be provided using standard protocols. One such protocol, known as MTConnect, is becoming increasingly popular to collect data from machine tools. Other useful data can be collected from production personnel using a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to monitor process output, consumable usage, and operator productivity. However, MTConnect data and IVIES data usually reside in separate systems that may be proprietary and expensive. This paper describes the development and implementation of a new MES, powered by Android devices and cloud computing tools, that combines MTConnect data with production data collected from operators; the proposed MES is particularly suitable for small manufacturing enterprises, as it is low-cost and easily implementable. A case study using the MES to track a production run of titanium parts is presented, and data from the MES are correlated with MTConnect data from a machine tool. This work is integral to realizing a complete digital model of the shop floor, known as the Shop Floor Digital Twin, that can be used for production control and optimization.

Earlier research usually considered ideal surface-based deviation models to conduct simulations, which ignore form defects. With the increasing demands on quality control, a skin model shape that includes form defects has its advantages. First, the effects of the chosen geometrical model on the assembly simulation are analyzed; the geometrical models considered are: nominal model, ideal surface-based deviation model, and skin model shape. The importance of form defects and assembly load conditions is highlighted. However, it is not easy to integrate all these factors into tolerance analysis. Difficulties in assembly simulation are discussed, such as the mating between non-ideal surfaces, model balance under external and internal loads, the consistency of simulation results, etc. Based on the analysis, a skin model shape-based tolerance analysis method, which also considers the load and displacement boundary conditions, is proposed. The assembly of the skin model shape is transformed into the objective function of a quadratic optimization problem, links between physical properties and optimization constraints are established. Corresponding simulation results are generated by conducting the optimization iteratively. To illustrate the method and validate its simulation result, various models are used as examples. Lastly, a simplified hand saw model is used as a case study.";0;2018;17

In the solution provided in the current research, a novel approach centred on applying digital twinning in the design of the requested processing architecture is presented. It involves designing the virtual prototype of the diffused processing architecture and modelling the glass waste flow as a hybrid material flow. Dedicated analysis and simulation software is then used for establishing installation architecture and the specific parameters for each processing and transport capacity. The assessment of different processing scenarios by virtual modelling and simulations can also be used for exploring options to increase productivity and profit for other different recycling architectures. The main practical value of the study consists of creating the means to improve the waste recycling of automotive windshields, float glass or construction glass panels with metallic meshes, all representing categories of waste insufficiently recycled in Romania. The simulation results of the study were validated by tests made on the glass panel recycling installation. Also, a recovery glass rate of minimum 85% of the amount of waste loaded into the recycling system was achieved, obtaining a waste recycling quantity three times higher than initially anticipated.;1;2018;8

With the diminishing focus on a device-specific development towards an adaptive production network, which is less hierarchical in the sense of the ""Internet of production"", and with the focus on the properties of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), new opportunities for the strengthening of metrology arise. Characteristic of these CPSs are sensors for multi-modal data acquisition, actuators for interaction with the environment, distributed computing power and the ability to spontaneously or permanently network itself. They form the basis for the creation of a ""digital shadow"" and thus are essential components of a model for process control. Current trends and challenges for metrology in networked production, such as multi-sensor systems, model-based measurements, virtual measurement processes or the integration into adaptable production systems, broaden the boundaries of future requirements of metrology, in particular with regard to its flexibility, speed and compatibility. A prerequisite is a scalable, specifiable information fusion.

Thus the manufacturing cell has generic services with minimal assumptions about what kind of product will be assembled, while the digital product description is designed collaboratively between the designer at an OEM and automated services at potential manufacturers. This has several advantages. Firstly, the resulting versatile manufacturing facility can handle a broad variety of products with minimal or no reconfiguration effort, so it can cost-effectively offer its services to a large number of OEMs. Secondly, a solution is presented to the problem of performing concurrent product design and assembly planning over the organizational boundary. Thirdly, the product design at the OEM is not constrained to the capabilities of specific manufacturing facilities. The concept is presented in general terms in UML and an implementation is provided in a 3D simulation environment using Automation Markup Language for digital product descriptions.

The proposed framework draws inspiration from past resource virtualization outcomes with special attention paid to the usability of the proposed framework in a business environment. It provides a straightforward process for companies to create digital twins by specifying the digital twin hierarchy, the information to be modeled, and the modeling method. To validate the proposed framework, a case study was undertaken at an international company, to create digital twins for all their manufacturing resources.

'Digital Twins' in engineering provide a conceptual framework to analyze these emerging data-driven health care practices, as well as their conceptual and ethical implications for therapy, preventative care and human enhancement. Digital Twins stand for a specific engineering paradigm, where individual physical artifacts are paired with digital models that dynamically reflects the status of those artifacts. When applied to persons, Digital Twins are an emerging technology that builds on in silico representations of an individual that dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status and life style over time. We use Digital Twins as the hypothesis that one would be in the possession of very detailed bio-physical and lifestyle information of a person over time. This perspective redefines the concept of 'normality' or 'health,' as a set of patterns that are regular for a particular individual, against the backdrop of patterns observed in the population. This perspective also will impact what is considered therapy and what is enhancement, as can be illustrated with the cases of the 'asymptomatic ill' and life extension via anti-aging medicine. These changes are the consequence of how meaning is derived, in case measurement data is available. Moral distinctions namely may be based on patterns found in these data and the meanings that are grafted on these patterns. Ethical and societal implications of Digital Twins are explored. Digital Twins imply a data-driven approach to health care. This approach has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits, and can function as a social equalizer, by allowing for effective equalizing enhancement interventions. It can as well though be a driver for inequality, given the fact that a Digital Twin might not be an accessible technology for everyone, and given the fact that patterns identified across a population of Digital Twins can lead to segmentation and discrimination. This duality calls for governance as this emerging technology matures, including measures that ensure transparency of data usage and derived benefits, and data privacy.;8;2018;11
J;"Tao, F; Cheng, JF; Qi, QL; Zhang, M; Zhang, H; Sui, FY";Digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing and service with big data;"Digital twin; Product lifecycle; Design; Manufacturing; Service; Big data; Cyber and physical convergence";Nowadays, along with the application of new-generation information technologies in industry and manufacturing, the big data-driven manufacturing era is coming. However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.;92;2018;14

In this framework, Digital Factory technologies, based on the employment of digital modelling and simulation tools, can be used for short-term analysis and validation of production control strategies or for medium term production planning or production system design/redesign. In this research work, a Digital Factory methodology is proposed to support the enhancement of an existing manufacturing cell for the fabrication of aircraft engine turbine vanes via robotic automation of its deburring station. To configure and verify the correct layout of the upgraded manufacturing cell with the aim to increase its performance in terms of resource utilization and throughput time, 3D Motion Simulation and Discrete Event Simulation are jointly employed for the modeling and simulation of different cell settings for proper layout configuration, safe motion planning and resource utilization improvement. Validation of the simulation model is carried out by collecting actual data from the physical reconfigured manufacturing cell and comparing these data to the model forecast with the aim to adapt the digital model accordingly to closely represent the physical manufacturing system.;6;2018;14

These digital twins are either EnergyPlus (E+) or data- driven (D+) building models, whose input and output van- ables are mapped to analogous real building OPC tags and track the real-time operation of the building. An E+ dig- ital twin can be used to provide predictions of the build- ing's performance in different weather, usage, and energy pricing scenarios, which allows for accurate assessment of different control strategies. However, it is not suitable for optimization and predictive control due to its complexity. We develop scalable D+ digital twin based on Gaussian Processes (GP) for accurate prediction and advanced con- trol. A D+ digital twin is much easier, faster, and less ex- pensive to tram than developing and tuning an E+ model, while still providing accurate power forecasts and being suitable for control.

All this leads to the fact that cycles for CNC machines are selected the same as for manually processing of a number of workpieces in a single cycle. In order to meet the accuracy requirements and quality design optimized for manually initially cycles, which have low regime's parameters. Therefore, the cycles obtained by the method of selection are not high-performance and they do not provide minimal processing time.

In addition, although in many cases mass production is being used, a particular emphasis has to be placed on individualized production. Connecting many products to the Internet, presence of sensors, wireless communications expansion, robot and intelligent machine development, real-time data analysis have the potential to turn the way in which production is made in what is considered to be the fourth revolution, called ""Industry 4.0"". The digital plant makes it possible to implement manufacturing processes, plant concepts and new technologies that, without simulation-based solutions, could not be put into practice or could be put into practice, as the case may be, but only by incurring considerable costs.

To achieve this long-term goal, several challenges must he overcome: among others, reliable and inline-capable characterization methods are the key technology to deliver input and verification for the digital representative (""digital twin""). This paper gives an overview of three ultrasonic methods developed for inline characterization of copper ribbons used to interconnect solar cells in a solar module. Material parameters of these ribbons are crucial for the soldering process and the future reliability of solar modules. The three methods are based on different physical effects: 1) Determination of elastic constants by ultrasonic dispersion analysis; 2) Acoustoelastic microstructural analysis; 3) Determination of mean grain size by ultrasonic scattering analysis. Each method has its own specific range of application: Method I proved to be very stable and reliable for elastic constant evaluation (Young's modulus, Poison's ratio) in all areas of ribbon production and module manufacturing. Method 2 is most sensitive and suitable for detecting small changes in microstructure due to mechanical loading or manufacturing process variation. It is therefore well-suited to inline quality check in module production. Method 3 allows determination of the mean grain size, characterizing the annealing process. Mechanical loading must be avoided here, as generated dislocations also influence the attenuation. The newly developed methods and achieved results indicate enormous potential for ribbon characterization on an industrial scale and fit well in the ""industry 4.0"" concept.";0;2018;5

The idea is that by performing Big data analytics on the past process data we can model what is (statistically analyzed) usual/normal for a selected period and check the variations from that model in the real-time (as Six Sigma requires). Additionally, these data-driven models can support the root cause analysis that should provide insights what can be eliminated as a waste in the process (as Lean requires). However, due to the above mentioned variety and volume of data, the analytics must be a) robust dealing with differences efficiently and b) scalable - realized in an extremely parallel way. We propose a novel method for process control that uses big data analytics approaches to deal with the multidimensionality and the large size of the process space. In order to realize this idea we develop a new concept of self aware digital twins which are able to reason about own behaviour and react if needed. Indeed, we revolutionize the concept of digital twins by extending their ""virtual replica"" (of physical objects) nature into ""digital self-awareness"" of physical objects (assets, systems), leading to the new generation of digital twins, so called self-aware DTs, which can ""reasons"" about the behaviour of an object (and not only mimic it) and actively participate in its improvement.

S;Riemer, D;Feeding the Digital Twin: Basics, Models and Lessons Learned from Building an IoT Analytics Toolbox (Invited Talk);"Stream Processing; Internet of Things; Self-Service";In many application domains such as manufacturing, the integration and continuous processing of real-time sensor data from the Internet of Things (IoT) provides users with the opportunity to continuously monitor and detect upcoming situations. One example is the optimization of maintenance processes based on the current condition of machines (condition-based maintenance). While continuous processing of events in scalable architectures is already well supported by the existing Big Data tool landscape, building such applications requires a still enormous effort which, besides programming skills, demands for a rather deep technical background on distributed, scalable infrastructures. Therefore, there is a need for more intuitive solutions supporting the development of real-time applications. In this talk, we present methods and tools enabling flexible modeling of real-time and batch processing pipelines by domain experts. We will present, lightweight, semantics-based models to describe sensors and data and look deeper into graphical modeling of processing pipelines, i.e., stream processing programs that can be defined using graphical tool support, but are automatically deployed in distributed stream processors.

S;"Zehnder, P; Riemer, D";Representing Industrial Data Streams in Digital Twins using Semantic Labeling;"digital twin; stream processing; semantic schema; IoT";Digital twins provide the opportunity to observe and simulate current and future behaviour of cyber-physical systems in a non-invasive way. At the same time, digital representations of real-world assets allow to compare multiple situations in parallel and to estimate effects of planned interventions. Such simulations can be used in cyper-physical systems to make predictions about the future and prevent failures. However, it is complex to build a model that accurately represents the real-world and connects real-world assets to technically-oriented data streams produced by these assets. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model so-called Industrial Data Streams. Such streams are produced by assets in the real world and are integrated on a message oriented middleware. Streams are annotated using the concept of semantic labels, which allows to assign characteristics such as location or type of the underlying assets to data streams. Our contribution consists of a semantic schema representation that categorises similar data streams, allowing subscribers to consume similar data from multiple assets within a single data analytics pipeline. Therefore, our approach paves the way for a more intuitive management of digital twin representations from industrial assets.;0;2018;4

Developing a reliable and robust digital replica of the physical systems of the value chain is one of the most advanced (and challenging) approaches to digitalization, condensed in the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT plays a fundamental role in creating a data-rich environment where simulation and optimization procedures can be run. With DT expected to become a commodity in the coming years, simulation and optimization become therefore a more accessible instrument for the improvement of manufacturing and business processes also in small enterprises with limited investment capacity. While scientific literature has analysed the adoption of DT in the optimization of products lifecycle, no contributions have yet focused on the exploitation of DT to improve the sustainability performances of whole value chains. In this paper we propose a reference framework where DTs built upon process and system data gathered from the field, allow to quickly assess the sustainability performances of both existing and planned production mixes and to compare achievable impacts with changing processes and technologies, thus enabling advisory features for sustainability-aware decision making in structured, multi-entity value networks.

For a long time, the design of solid rocket motor is mainly based on experience and semi experience, there are problems such as simulation and test separation, and design data can not be fully applied, which seriously restricts the improvement of design level of solid rocket motor. Therefore, in recent years, domestic and foreign researchers have been committed to introducing advanced information technology into the field of solid rocket motor design, thus breaking through the design bottleneck of solid rocket motor. Through the close combination and mutual mapping of physical space and virtual space, Digital Twins can solve the above problems. Based on the conceptual connotation of digital twins, this paper studies the application of digital twins in the life cycle of solid engine design, and focuses on the analysis of the top-level architecture of digital twins and the method of data transfer in digital twins.

However, the application of I4.0 technologies in this sector has hardly been examined yet. For determining I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production, a structured approach is required since the variety of sub-processes and production technologies results in a vast number of possible combinations. Therefore, this paper first compares different generic approaches for identifying, selecting and implementing I4.0 use cases. Building on this, a methodical approach is derived in order to tap the numerous I4.0 potentials within the electric motor production. On the one hand, use cases can be derived from current technological opportunities resulting from application examples and best practices in research and industry. On the other hand, concrete problems in critical manufacturing processes can give rise to the application of novel I4.0 solutions. By presenting a comprehensive overview of promising application scenarios, this paper mainly facilitates the identification of I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production from an opportunity-driven perspective. In addition to approaches directly addressing the electric motor production, concepts can be derived from related processes in other application domains. Examples are provided by outlining a selection of the presumably most relevant use cases. The results indicate that especially data-driven approaches, i.e. data analytics and machine learning, offer great potential in electric motor production. As an outlook, I4.0 potentials can also be disclosed from a problem-pull perspective, supplementing the opportunity-push approach of this paper.;0;2018;13

The main goal of the research is obtaining of hemodynamic and shear stress for creating the digital twin of coronary heart vessels. The results were obtained for low Reynolds numbers about 20 of three-dimensional laminar flow. With this Reynolds number the turbulent flow of the blood is modelled by Realizable k-epsilon model, and SST models to the narrowing, expansions, and blocks inside the vessels.

These Digital Twins are evolving to become instrumental assets that accompany the product throughout its lifetime, enabling virtual quality assurance, virtual sensing and model-based control. However, in mechatronics, the typical CAE design models are relatively expensive physics based models which cannot be directly used throughout the entire lifecycle as Digital Twins. Model order reduction approaches for these nonlinear dynamic applications allow to reduce the computational cost sufficiently for use in a Digital Twin setting.

A central aspect of a digital factory is that of enabling the product lifecycle stakeholders to collaborate through the use of software solutions. The digital factory thus expands outside the actual company boundaries and offers the opportunity for the business and its suppliers to collaborate on business processes that affect the whole supply chain. This paper discusses an interoperability architecture for digital factories. To this end, it delves into the issue by analysing the main challenges that must be addressed to support an integrated and scalable factory architecture characterized by access to services, aggregation of data, and orchestration of production processes.

The development process has to ensure that every product is manufactured at the end with an efficient production process. Under these conditions, data management and the use of simulations become more important. Furthermore, the couplings and interrelations between product and means of production play a key role in the areas of digital factory and virtual commissioning. Only by using both simulation methods it will become apparent how the product can be manufactured. But to create a virtual commissioning model, a lot of data is needed from the entire development process. This data is usually generated interdisciplinarily by people from various departments. However, today's form of data management as information transfer is only conditionally suitable for efficiently building up a digital factory as a simulation model or even making a virtual commissioning of a production system. Due to the fact that in the development process a lot of IT systems with interfaces inbetween are used, loss of information is quite common experience. This is where graph-based design languages come in. Using this modeling language approach, the product is completely digitally described and then the means of production are derived from the product properties automatically. This creates a consistent digital product life cycle from the initial product requirements to virtual commissioning.;0;2018;10

Hereby, a data acquisition and model reconstruction methodology has been combined to resolve these issues. Such a data set often has to replace the missing original digital model. Subsequently, a model reconstruction plan has to be derived so that an editable CAD model which fulfils process requirements can be generated using standard geometry creation tools. Such a reversed engineered CAD model preferably contains form-feature based design intent and can be easily modified due to new design and manufacturing constraints. In some cases the scanned data are not complete due to the gaps in the acquisition procedure. To repair such meshes mobile low-cost scanner can be taken into account. In this paper the Microsoft HoloLens is used, a mixed reality headset. It scans the environment around and enables the user to place holograms on the real world and interact with it. To permit this experience, the HoloLens scans our environment and reconstructs a spatial mapping 3D mesh of it. So this device is used as in-door scenes 3D scanner to reconstruct a piping system. This approach is proven in reconstruction of piping systems.;0;2018;10

This is largely true whether you are talking about employees, organizations, processes, time management, sports teams, or - to highlight a current global industry topic - Smart Manufacturing. The techniques for measuring the performance of a Smart Manufacturing facility are like those in regular use at most production factories: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The major differences are the number of stakeholder types responsible for achieving the KPI targets, and the breadth of available technologies they can apply in the process. Given the level of automation in today's leading semiconductor manufacturing plants, the most important tools these stakeholders have are the manufacturing applications that provide data analysis, decision support, production scheduling, process monitoring and control, yield management, and a host of other capabilities necessary for running a profitable enterprise in a hyper-competitive industry. In a Smart Manufacturing environment, these applications may interact not only with physical entities in the factory, but also components of its so-called ""digital twin"" to perform their functions. However, regardless of the overall system architecture or specific technologies used in these applications, they all depend on good data. and lots of it. And most of this data comes directly from the manufacturing equipment, which may number in the thousands for a high-volume factory. As a result, the importance of rich equipment models and robust integration standards for accessing that information cannot be overstated.

More in details, these analyses are related to the variability of production quality, prediction of the maintenance cycle, the accurate estimation of energy consumption and other extra-functional properties of the system. This is the core of what is so called Industry 4.0. Every single node of the manufacturing process needs to be modelled as a Cyber-physical system to be able to make the mentioned analyses. However, Manufacturing simulators represent these systems with a high level of abstraction, making impossible precise analyses. In the state of the art, some solutions try to solve the problem connecting multiple domain-specific simulators, to preserve details but requiring complex co-simulation environments. This paper presents a methodology for the integration of CyberPhysical Systems in production line simulators, avoiding these issues. The proposed solution is based on a new promising technology: the Function Mockup Interface (FMI). This standard defines an interface to exports models as blocks called Functional Mockup Units (FMUs). These FMUs can be easily integrated together composing heterogeneous systems. The methodology is composed of two steps: 1) Exporting Digital and Physical systems as different FMUs 2) Integration of the FMUs into a production line simulator. An example is used to validate our solution which clearly shows the limitations of the production line simulator without the integration of CPSs. This paper aims at producing Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) to make more accurate simulations, and hence more accurate analysis of the production line.;0;2018;6

Various arrival processes are modelled in order to comply with the periodic variations observed in data history as well as exceptional massive arrivals that may be related to major crisis. A practical experiment is provided in order to determine the best available leverages to optimize the operations of the system.;0;2018;12
S;"Lacomblez, M; Jeanne, B; Havard, V; Baudry, D";Co-Simulation Architecture Between a Digital Twin and a Virtual Reality Environment in an Industrial Context;"Digital Twin; Industry 4.0; Co-Simulation Architecture; Simulation; Virtual Reality";In the context of Industry 4.0 and digital factory, digital twin and virtual reality represent technologies that can deal with several industrial issues like design, simulation and optimisation of industrial systems. They are helpful to develop collaboration, innovation or training. The major goal of this article is to propose an architecture of communication, based on Functional Mockup Interface to standardize communication processes and development between simulation software and virtual reality software. The architecture is subdivided in three parts: the first one manages the simulation of digital twins and their physical constraints, the second one manages the data transfer between simulation and visualisation software and the last one manages interactions with digital twins within a virtual reality environment. This was developed with 3DEXPERIENCE as simulation software, Unity as 3D rendering and visualisation software and C# and C++ programs to manage data transfer. The implementation of that digital twin architecture is demonstrated on an UR10, a 6-axis cobotic arm.;1;2018;6

One of the key challenges is to keep the digital twin up-to-date with changes of the real one. Today, laser scanning is the de-facto standard used to keep the geometry of the digital model synchronized. In recent years, advancements in the performance of Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) and the availability of cheap high-resolution digital cameras have made photogrammetry a viable alternative to laser scanning for building digital 3D-models. In this study, we investigate how photogrammetry competes against laser-scanning by comparing their results in form of point-clouds.;0;2018;7
S;"Khan, A; Dahl, M; Falkman, P; Fabian, M";Digital Twin for Legacy Systems: Simulation Model Testing and Validation;;In this paper, an approach to incorporate a digital twin for legacy production systems is presented. Hardware-in-the-loop setups are routinely used by manufacturing companies to carry out virtual commissioning. However, manufacturing companies having online legacy production systems are still struggling to incorporate a digital twin due to the absence of verified and validated simulation models. Companies that use virtual commissioning as a part of their engineering tool chain, usually perform offline verification of the simulation model. This approach is typically based on visual inspection and is a tedious task as each aspect of the model has to be visually validated. For legacy systems, only assessing the behavior visually in the absence of updated documents can result in an incorrect simulation model, i.e. simulating incorrect behavior with respect to the specification. Due to this, such simulation models cannot be incorporated in the engineering tool chain, as the simulated results can lead to improper decisions and can even cause equipment damage. This paper presents a platform and an approach, based on model-based testing, that is a first step for manufacturing companies to incorporate a validated simulation model for existing online production systems that will serve as a digital twin.;1;2018;6

Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.;1;2018;12
S;"Hlady, J; Glanzer, M; Fugate, L";AUTOMATED CREATION OF THE PIPELINE DIGITAL TWIN DURING CONSTRUCTION - IMPROVEMENT TO CONSTRUCTION QUALITY AND PIPELINE INTEGRITY;;The concept of the digital twin dates all the way back to the 1950's when NASA, GE and other industrial manufacturers started creating abstract digital models of equipment to model their performance in simulations and maintain a record of the asset throughout its life span [1]. Over the years more and more industries have adopted the digital twin paradigm to improve traceability, maintenance, and analytics allowing for improved sustainment of the asset or equipment while reducing various risks identified during life cycle management. It has been found that collectively, the digital twin concept improves the overall net present value of an asset. The oil and gas industry has slowly been adopting the digital twin paradigm of asset life cycle management over the past two decades with the focus on facilities. Recently, field trials were completed to test and evaluate workflows and sensor platforms for the creation of a digital twin for pipelines. The trials resulted in highly accurate pipeline centerlines, weld locations, Depth to Cover (DoC) and ditch geometry capture in digital formats. This paper describes the methodologies used, and the results of an actual construction field trial with a comparison to traditional data collection methods for these attributes. The value of creating a pipeline digital twin during pipeline construction in near-real-time is discussed with an emphasis on the potential benefits to life cycle management and pipeline integrity.;0;2018;12
B;"Martins, TW; Niemczik, L; Anderl, R";CONCEPT OF AN AUTOMATIC INTEGRATION OF PARTS MEASUREMENT DATA INTO FEATURE-BASED CAD MODELS;;This paper introduces a concept to integrate measurements data into feature-based 3D CAD models. The concept focuses on its application in the measurement of bifurcated sheet metal profiles. For that, an interface to read and import this data into the CAD system is developed. Since the measurement data is stored as a point cloud, further data processing (reverse engineering) is necessary to recreate the work piece shape in the CAD system. If the measured work piece model and the CAD model of the design piece are available, an automated comparison of the defined dimension takes place. The result is a notification in the CAD model indicating which dimension deviates from the target values. Use-cases are elaborated for integrating the concept in the product development process. To implement this concept, an experimental setup is built up consisting of a measurement system and 3D CAD system. The COPRA ProfileScan Desktop is used to measure the profile. Siemens NX 11 is the chosen CAD system. Based on this setup, the concept is validated on a manufactured profile.;0;2018;11

We propose an instrumented glove with only a few strain gauge sensors and a micro-controller that continuously tracks and records the hand configuration during actual use. At the heart of our approach is a trainable system that can predict the fourteen joint angles in the hand using only a small set of strain sensors. First, ten strain gauges are placed at the various joints in the hand to optimize the sensor layout using the English letters in the American Sign Language as a benchmark for assessment. Next, the best sensor configurations for three through ten strain gauges are computed using a support vector machine classifier. Following the layout optimization, our approach learns a mapping between the sensor readouts to the actual joint angles optically captured using a Leap Motion system. Three regression methods including linear, quadratic and neural regression are then used to train the mapping between the strain gauge data and the corresponding joint angles. The final proposed model involves four strain gauges mapped to the fourteen joint angles using a two-layer feed-forward neural network.;0;2018;9

To properly simulate modern machine tools in machining condition, which show close interaction between the dynamic behavior of the mechanical structure, drives, and the CNC, we use an integrated methodology that combines control and MBS capabilities in a nonlinear FEA solver called SAMCEF Mecano. To fully capture the dynamic behavior of the machine, force interactions between the cutting tool and the workpiece are also considered. A strong coupling between the mechatronic model of the machine tool and a machining simulation tool is implemented. A specialized cutting force element has been developed. It considers the dynamics of the tool tip combined with the tool workpiece engagement to generate cutting forces. The use of such digital twin model is demonstrated considering some industrial machining operations.;0;2018;8

The application of BIM is not as straightforward as it sounds though, with numerous software solutions available, various implementation processes across the project lifecycle, which challenges the interoperability and how information flows throughout the various project stages. This paper performs and presents a systematic review of the BIM software landscape currently available for the construction industry across the various project phases and in alignment with the 2013 RIBA Plan of Works. A gap analysis is conducted among these BIM solutions to examine the different software application areas, software architecture, interoperability possibilities, accessibility and affordability, by applying descriptive statistics. Surprisingly, the BIM software ecosystem is fragmented across the different project stages and highly proprietary and further hindered by the large number of specialised and highly sophisticated solutions addressed to advanced computer users. To this end, the paper aims to inform the industry's stakeholders, policy makers and software vendors, while shedding light on the extent that sophisticated BIM solutions can be disseminated to the market.;0;2018;8

ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system's topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0-1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.";0;2018;22

The national economy's orientation toward the use of modern achievements of the digital industry will contribute to a faster transition to the global information society. Digitalization of education will make it possible to use the latest scientific achievements for the development of other areas of life in society. This study presents a model that applies distributed registry technologies based on blockchains and smart contracts for the reliable storage and efficient use of date relating to the population's professional competencies. This model aims to create a unified information environment for interaction between all the actors of the economic system. The authors developed the model for registering professional competencies of the population and their developmental paths based on modem digital technologies. We substantiate the efficiency and security assured by blockchain technology for information storage and transmission. Educational institutions of all levels, governmental authorities controlling education, and people taking part in the educational process are the basic actors of the system presented. The proposed model presents the educational level and professional skills of each registered person as an education index (ED, which keeps track of all educational achievements and professional competencies of the participant over their lifetime. When calculating the EI , the authors also propose to consider ratings of the educational institutions responsible for the participant's professional skills. The implementation of the EI will significantly simplify the process of employing graduates from various educational institutions, as well as the college admissions process. In addition, analytic tools could be used to create ratings of colleges, school departments, and even specific teachers. The registry of professional competencies we developed is directed at the processing and storage of large volumes of data (Big Data).

Along with the increasing computing power and connectivity, they are becoming more intelligent and can make decisions on their own. Amongst others, these tasks include the self-optimization and self-configuration of the production system. In addition, such cyber-physical production systems can contribute to the planning phase of a manufacturing system, e.g. when the production process must be adapted to a new product.

An important factor for competitiveness is the targeted design of the factory. Factory planning must identify future requirements for the entire factory at an early stage and transfer them to a suitable factory structure. If this does not happen, the ability of companies to change will be restricted. In order to counter this risk, the digital factory with its digital tools and methods provides a solid basis for assisting planners with the design and realizing the required goals for the factory. Using modern digital assistance systems in factory planning, relevant planning restrictions can be identified and the planning status can be visualized and validated. It is unclear what effects the new requirements and in some cases disruptive changes will have on the classic factory planning process. This article discusses the use of business process modeling to identify, model, analyze and adapt classic factory planning processes. The goal is to generate future-proof factory planning processes. These form the basis for adapting classic tools and methods at the digital factory to the new processes. The digital factory 4.0 is created.;0;2018;5

S;"Karakra, A; Fontanili, F; Lamine, E; Lamothe, J; Taweel, A";PERVASIVE COMPUTING INTEGRATED DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION FOR A HOSPITAL DIGITAL TWIN;"Digital Twin; DES; IOT; Pervasive Computing; Hospital Services";A hospital is an ecosystem that includes real-time services that require high human interaction on both resources level (doctor, nurses, etc.) and entities level (patients). Designing, planning, improving and controlling this system can be very challenging due to the system complexity governed by several subjective factors that affect the hospital interrelated functions or services. However, continuously changing health care needs that consistently face hospitals require them to keep continuously improving the efficiency of these services as demand increases and as new services are added. This paper proposes a new methodology that uses the concept of Digital Twin (DT) of hospital services based on Discrete Event Simulation (DES) integrated with health care information systems and Internet of things (IoT) devices. It develops a predictive decision support model that employs real-time services data drawn from these systems and devices. This model enables assessing the efficiency of existing health care delivery systems and evaluating the impact of changes in services without disrupting daily activities of the hospital. The developed model, a digital twin (or a virtual replica of the hospital), simulates a number of key hospital health delivery services, based on relevant data retrieved in real-time. Although the model simulates four key services, initially as a proof of concept, but it proposes a general framework, which can be expanded to include other services. The demonstrated proof-of-concept shows that it achieves better planning and improvement of usage of resources, and thus enabling both practitioners and management to examine any model changes to foresee the effectiveness or efficiency of services before they are applied in reality.;0;2018;6
B;"Eckhart, M; Ekelhart, A";A Specification-based State Replication Approach for Digital Twins;"Cyber-physical systems; industrial control systems; digital twin; state replication; intrusion detection systems; AutomationML";Digital twins play a key role in realizing the vision of a smart factory. While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.;0;2018;12

In many cases it is desirable to obtain a 3D model of a factory floor and machinery, that can be used for visualization of Digital Twin models. Current commercial 3D reconstruction solutions involve the use of high-end LiDAR sensors which increase the cost of the 3D scanning process and suppose a barrier for SME factories on their path towards Industry 4.0. The paper presents a comparison of 3D reconstruction results using low-cost sensors including a Zenfone AR mobile phone, an Intel RealSense ZR300 and a Kinect v2. The small size and weight of the sensors make it possible to be mounted on small unmanned aerial vehicles and enable future 3D reconstruction in an autonomous manner. The data was processed using an open source Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) library RTAB-Map. The results were compared with a professional 3D scan using a GeoSLAM LiDAR.

B;"Patnaik, P; Wu, XJ";LINKING MRO TO PROGNOSIS BASED HEALTH MANAGEMENT THROUGH PHYSICS-OF-FAILURES UNDERSTANDING;;Traditional engine maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) are geared toward fixed schedules. However, with online condition monitoring, assessments and prognosis, it is required that MRO be adaptive to the life consumption with respect to the actual usage of the engine to realize the benefit of prognosis. Shifting to this new paradigm, there are several challenges: 1. How exactly the life is consumed in components under complex usage profiles that may involve a combination of low and high cycle fatigue, thermomechanical fatigue and creep, for regular usage (aside from incidents)? 2. What are the physical failure mechanism(s) in components under the above conditions, the understanding of which may help to select the most appropriate detection, repair and replacement (including material insertion) strategy, for life renewal/extension and cost reduction? 3. Understanding the limitations of repairs for the particular failure mechanism. To overcome these challenges, one needs physics-based material failure models that can reflect the true failure mechanisms on the component level under actual (complex) usage profiles. Conventional, empirical test-data correlations for isolated conditions fall short of this requirement because pure fatigue and pure creep are not experienced by real components in service. In addition, to ensure the repaired component's structural integrity, the material database would have to be comprehensive enough to cover the effect of intrinsic repair defects and microstructures that are not present in the original component material. While models and data are integral parts of digital twins, it is proposed that physics-based models are needed to cover the entire application domain continuously. This paper will introduce a physics-based method of life consumption evaluation and discussion through past experience in line with the development of Digital Twin concepts for sustainment.;0;2018;8

Accurate failure detection and life prediction methods also result in reduced maintenance costs. The major challenges in fleet monitoring are the great amount of collected data that need to be processed and the variability between engines of the fleet, which requires adaptive models. In this paper, a framework for monitoring, diagnostics, and health management of a fleet of aircrafts is proposed. The framework consists of a multi-level approach: starting from thresholds exceedance monitoring, problematic engines are isolated, on which a fault detection system is then applied. Different methods for fault isolation, identification, and quantification are presented and compared, and the related challenges and opportunities are discussed.

B;Wittig, N;DIGITALIZATION: LASER METAL DEPOSITION - THE FUTURE OF SPARE PARTS AND REPAIRS FOR INDUSTRIAL STEAM TURBINES;;Laser metal deposition (LMD) also referred to as laser deposition welding has been a well-established process for years. One example of its use is for tip repair for gas turbine blades from Siemens. The decision to also implement laser welding technology for the service of industrial steam turbines was based primarily on the fact that repairs especially conventional welds and coatings including heat treatment and testing are very time consuming and are very difficult to reconcile with the overhaul periods planned by customers. The robot supported automation of the LMD process and the fact of its lower heat input, reduced layer thicknesses and the resulting lowered deformation of the part due to reduced coating areas makes it possible to optimize lead times. The high level of process automation and reliability of a laser welding process represents another important benefit. Similarly, process parameters are constantly monitored and tracked, to ensure that the required quality standards are maintained and even increased. Furthermore, laser metal deposition completely replaced the conventional processes such as tungsten inert gas method (TIG), plasma transferred arc (PTA) and detonation spraying. In addition the technology unleashes now the possibility to repair and refurbish parts instead of new manufacturing, and therefore delivery times can be tremendously reduced. Based on the decision to six-axis robots it becomes possible enhancing the LMD process for complex 3D surfaces. After modeling a digital twin in Siemens NX CAM it is possible to generate, optimize and simulate the whole motion-sequences offline before starting the LMD process in the robot cell. So already designed parts in 3D-CAD can be used to develop the final robot program. In addition already existing technologies like 3D surface scanning will be implemented in the chain to support the LIVID process. Digitalization turns from a buzzword to an established technology for industrial steam turbine manufacturing and repair.;0;2018;7
J;"Rozentsvaig, AI; Kovalenko, KE";ECOSYSTEM APPROACH TO THE LEGAL REGULATION OF DIGITAL ECONOMY;"digital economy; ecosystem; digital ecosystem; transformation of society; ecosystem approach; ecosystem management; International Economy Law";"This article discusses several aspects of Digital Economy. Firstly, the term ""ecosystem"" is analyzed according to the concept of ""ecology"". Secondly, ecosystem approach is viewed as the concept that describes the evolution of the nature of interactions of economic agents, models of their innovation activity and their relationship with the environment of functioning. Thirdly, current issues for Digital Economy are identified. The paper concludes that ecosystem approach considers innovative systems of all levels (national, regional, cluster, etc.) as living social organism subjects. The ecosystem approach puts forward a number of important economic principles: firstly, the ecosystem has its own, market mechanisms of self-development; secondly, it focuses mostly on the nature and dynamics of interactions (with each other and with potential participants), emphasizing that it is the collaboration that creates and diffuses the flow of knowledge, the transformation of these flows into innovation and further spread of innovations throughout the economy. We emphasize the role of openness for uniting the efforts of the community interested in the development of a digital industry, extension of public-private partnerships and building a competitive environment in order to ensure the rapid growth of available digital services, as well as to improve their quality. The emergence of the issue of digital economy has introduced a new driving force to the transformation of international society. The principles of ecosystem management and the principles of the ecosystem approach should underpin any decisions taken at the universal, regional and national levels.";0;2018;7

In contrast to this static application of CPS technology, research conducted jointly by U.S. Department of Energy's, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and Ames Laboratory proposes a new paradigm in which CPS is used as a core technology in energy system development, design, and deployment. The goal is to speed up the development and deployment of advanced concept power plants, reduce the cost and thereby encouraging private and public investment, and substantially reduce the risk of failure. The current technology development paradigm generally starts with models and bench-scale tests, leading to a pilot plant demonstration of the technology before construction of a commercial system. The concept proposed by NEIL and Ames incorporates CPS before and during the construction of a pilot plant arguably the highest risk part of implementing new energy technologies and then extends the cyber physical infrastructure to the full-scale plant creating a fully functional and coupled digital twin. The creation of a cyber-physical platform as a part of the advanced energy system design and deployment has the potential to enable the ""customization"" of energy systems to meet local needs and resources. This will reduce cost and environmental impact of energy production and use. Examples of how the technology development process can be changed in the energy sector will be discussed using fuel cell turbine hybrids as an example.";0;2018;10

B;Woo, W;Augmented Human: Augmented Reality and Beyond;"Augmented Reality; Augmented Human; Alternated Realties; holistic Quantified Self; E-Personality";Will Augmented Reality (AR) allow us to access digital information, experience others' stories, and thus explore alternate realities? AR has recently attracted attention again due to the rapid advances in related multimedia technologies as well as various glass-type AR display devices. However, in order to widely adopt AR in alternated realities, it is necessary to improve various core technologies and integrate them into an AR platform. Especially, there are several remaining technical challenges such as 1) real-time recognition and tracking of multiple objects while generating an environment map, 2) organic user interface with awareness of user's implicit needs, intentions or emotion as well as explicit requests, 3) immersive multimodal content augmentation and just-in-time information visualization, 4) multimodal interaction and collaboration during augmented telecommunication, etc. In addition, in order to encourage user engagement and enable an AR ecosystem, AR standards should be established that support creating AR content, capturing user experiences, and sharing the captured experiences. What about humans in that regard? Are humans ready to live happily in the age of alternate realities? Even if humans actively use AR in their daily lives to explore alternate realities, overuse can lead to passive lives like avatars, rather than improving efficiency or expanding their abilities. In other words, such a high dependence on the AR can contribute towards degrading or even losing human's abilities and ultimately lower the quality of life (QoL). Though technology has been developed as a tool to expand humans' abilities and improve QoL, sometimes technology is seen as a threat to overwhelm or replace human. In addition, sometimes technology addiction causes humans to be isolated or alienated from society. If so, what do humans gain and lose, if they actively use AR as a tool to access, manipulate, and maintain a variety of information through place or objects of interest (PoI or OoI) in alternate realities? Will future humans rather be Homo Deus or humans who rely less and less on their intellectual capabilities? How should we prepare for the future where human, reality and alternate realities co-exist? An Augmented Human (AH) is a person who is able to use AR effectively to expand the physical, intellectual and social abilities of the user [1,2]. How then can a human become an AH? First, the AH platform, the bridge between human and AH, needs a personalized agent that understands and represents the human [3,4,5]. The agent monitors the human's actions and reactions, negotiate with other agents on behalf of the human, and provide appropriate alternatives to make appropriate choices or decisions. The agent constantly collects and analyzes the signals of various sensors over a long period of time to construct a digital twin with Holistic Quantified Self (HQS) that consists of 1) a physical condition, 2) an emotional status, 3) a social relationship status, and 4) a digital consumption behavior status. Consequently, the agent is ready to act as a personalized companion by monitoring the individual's digital personality by observing HQS patterns and changes over time. In this keynote, I introduce the current states of AR and VR and then explain the implications of AR /VR as a new medium or platform that extends human abilities beyond time and space [6,7,8,9,10]. In particular, I explain the potential of VR/AR combined with Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 3D digital maps, and discuss various possible applications in everyday life where 'reality and alternated realities' coexist. Finally, I will look at the future of humans in the alternated realities era and share my view on possible AH technology capable of broadening human' s physical, intellectual and social abilities.;1;2018;2

B;"Song, SJ; Jang, YG";Construction of Digital Twin Geotechnical Resistance Model for Liquefaction Risk Evaluation;"Ground liquefaction; Ground resistance; Three - dimensional ground resistance modeling; GIS; Digital twin";In Korea, a strong earthquake of 5.8 and 5.4 magnitude occurred in Gyeongju in September 2016 and Pohang in November 2018 respectively. In the case of the Pohang Earthquake, the ground is losing its resistance and the ground liquefaction phenomenon that is behaving like a liquid is officially reported. In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three-dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.;0;2018;6

Supported by a growing number of new technologies, this concept appears more flexible and less expensive than traditional enterprise information systems such as ERP and MES. However, SMEs find themselves ill-equipped to face these new possibilities regarding their production planning and control functions. This paper presents a literature review of existing applied research covering different Industry 4.0 issues with regard to SMEs. Papers are classified according to a new framework which allows identification of the targeted performance objectives, the required managerial capacities and the selected group of technologies for each selected case. Our results show that SMEs do not exploit all the resources for implementing Industry 4.0 and often limit themselves to the adoption of Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. Likewise, SMEs seem to have adopted Industry 4.0 concepts only for monitoring industrial processes and there is still absence of real applications in the field of production planning. Finally, our literature review shows that reported Industry 4.0 projects in SMEs remained cost-driven initiatives and there in still no evidence of real business model transformation at this time.;42;2018;19
S;"Liau, Y; Lee, H; Ryu, K";Digital Twin concept for smart injection molding;;Injection molding industry has evolved over decades and became the most common method to manufacture plastic parts. Monitoring and improvement in the injection molding industry are usually performed separately in each stage, i.e. mold design, mold making and injection molding process. However, in order to make a breakthrough and survive in the industrial revolution, all the stages in injection molding need to be linked and communicated with each other. Any changes in one stage will cause a certain effect in other stage because there is a correlation between each other. Hence, the simulation should not only based on the input of historical data, but it also needs to include the current condition of equipment and prediction of future events in other stages to make the responsive decision. This can be achieved by implementing the concept of Digital Twin that models the entire process as a virtual model and enables bidirectional control with the physical process. This paper presented types of data and technology required to build the Digital Twin for the injection molding industry. The concept includes Digital Twin of each stage and integration of these Digital Twin model as a thoroughgoing model of the injection molding industry.;1;2018;5

Design/methodology/approach The study performs a systematic and content-centric review of literature based on a six-stage approach to identify key design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0. The study further benefits from a comprehensive content analysis of the 178 documents identified, both manually and via IBM Watson's natural language processing for advanced text analysis. Findings Industry 4.0 is an integrative system of value creation that is comprised of 12 design principles and 14 technology trends. Industry 4.0 is no longer a hype and manufacturers need to get on board sooner rather than later. Research limitations/implications The strategic roadmap presented in this study can serve academicians and practitioners as a stepping stone for development of a detailed strategic roadmap for successful transition from traditional manufacturing into the Industry 4.0. However, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy that suits all businesses or industries, meaning that the Industry 4.0 roadmap for each company is idiosyncratic, and should be devised based on company's core competencies, motivations, capabilities, intent, goals, priorities and budgets. Practical implications The first step for transitioning into the Industry 4.0 is the development of a comprehensive strategic roadmap that carefully identifies and plans every single step a manufacturing company needs to take, as well as the timeline, and the costs and benefits associated with each step. The strategic roadmap presented in this study can offer as a holistic view of common steps that manufacturers need to undertake in their transition toward the Industry 4.0. Originality/value The study is among the first to identify, cluster and describe design principles and technology trends that are building blocks of the Industry 4.0. The strategic roadmap for Industry 4.0 transition presented in this study is expected to assist contemporary manufacturers to understand what implementing the Industry 4.0 really requires of them and what challenges they might face during the transition process.;14;2018;27

The precise metabolomic study of living organisms is currently hampered by measurement sensitivity; most metabolomic measurement techniques involve some compromise, whereby averaging is performed over a volume significantly larger than a single cell, or require the invasion of the organism, or an arrested state of the organism. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an inherently noninvasive chemometric and imaging method, and hence, in principle, suitable for metabolomic measurements. The digital twin of metabolomics is computational systems biology, such that NMR microscopy is potentially a viable approach to joining the theoretical and experimental explorations of the metabolomic and behavioural responses of organisms. In this study, we consider the challenge of performing in vivo NMR-based metabolomics on the small organism Caenorhabditis elegans, point the way towards possible solutions created using techniques specific to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication, and highlight currently insurmountable challenges.";2;2018;10

Thus far, the studies on illegal digital activities have covered ambiguous interpretations of digital shadow economy that incorporated both criminal and economic aspects of the activities performed. The results of the empirical research have enabled to formulate the definition of digital shadow economy that refers to illegal activities, such as digital service provision and sales of goods/services online, when operating exceptionally in digital space, the entities violate the existent legal norms and regulations with a pursuit of illegal mutual interest and material benefits. The newly formulated definition of digital shadow economy has served as a corner-stone for identification of the distinctive features and channels of this phenomenon. Hence, the results of the research may make a significant and weighty contribution to the development of the theory of economics and may raise the awareness of what the phenomenon of digital shadow economy implies.;2;2018;22

J;"Ilc, N; Lotric, U";Implementation of a training-model simulator with free tools;;One of the important modern concepts in production optimization is implementation and usage of digital twins - virtual copies of physical setups. There are many tools on the market targeting at the digital twin concept, but are payable and for small projects it is difficult to justify the initial investment. For the needs of a faculty course, we developed our own simulator with a 3D visualization of physical training models based on the Unity game engine. The simulator imitates the physical devices well enough to enable students developing efficient programs for industrial controllers and practicing integration with higher-level systems. The simulator greatly alleviates the work on project tasks and contributes to more accomplished final projects. The tools and procedures used to create the simulator present a good base for the development of more complex simulators of other training models or even industrial systems.;0;2018;8

However, existing AGV fleet management solutions often suffer from poor integration with real-time manufacturing operations information systems, which negatively affects scheduling of AGVs. To exploit the full potential of AGVs in achieving just-in-time (JIT) transportation, there is a need for intelligent AGV fleet management system which not only integrate with manufacturing information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) but also provide prediction for the shop-floor logistic based on real-time manufacturing operations information to optimize scheduling of AGVs. This paper presents an approach for a Smart AGV Management System (SAMS), which combines the real-time data analysis and digital twin models that can be deployed within complex manufacturing environments for optimized scheduling. For a proof of concept, a case study of a line side supply of components to a manual assembly station is presented.;0;2018;6

To facilitate better decisions about the mechanical properties of the part and, consequently, the need for re-work, a manufacturing database is proposed that creates a digital twin of the part as manufactured. The main contribution of the paper is to highlight how to merge incoming sensor data into the database and how to use these data to determine the margin of safety for the part.

Some commercial product and manufacturing process modelling tools are currently integrated via semantic modelling technologies to match product with required processes and resources to achieve production requirements such as volume, cost etc. Despite these achievements, product design is still dependent on the knowledge of designers and do not benefit from existing process and resource knowledge, which are in separate domains. This paper therefore presents an integration method based on semantic technologies and PPR ontologies to reuse existing process and resource knowledge and automatically map it with product attributes and production requirements. The approach will help in improving efficiency of the response to frequently changing products and production requirements.;0;2018;6
S;"Berger, M; Muller, T; Meiers, B; Sauer, S; Krappig, R; Baum, C; Brecher, C";Automated assembly of lens barrels with active wavefront sensor guiding;"Active alignment; wavefront sensors; wavefront based alignment; lens barrel; optics";Miniaturized optics are main-components in many different areas ranging from smart devices over medical products to the area of automotive and mobility. Thus several millions if not billions of small lenses are merged into objectives. One characteristic type of objective holder is the lens barrel. The successful assembly of lenses with diameters of just a couple of millimeters into a lens barrel is an error-prone task antagonized with mass production and an optical inspection at the end of the assembly. Obviously, this process is neither time- nor cost-effective. Furthermore, the increasing imaging qualities demand for highly accurate aligned lens systems. The demand for high-quality optics in large quantities together with the small dimensions of the lenses make assembling a complex process. The Fraunhofer IPT investigates a much more elegant way inspecting the optical system during the fully automated assembly. In the assembly cell, our six-axis micromanipulator aligns the lens camera-led in the lens barrel. Next, the wavefront sensor analyses the imaging function of the lens and compares the actual status with the data from the optic model. This feedback loop between wavefront sensor and micromanipulator continues until the best position is found. We save this information as a digital twin and continue with the next lenses until the optics is completed. The observation of the optical function during the assembly process leads to high quality objectives produced in short cycle times. Moreover, our assembly cell is modular and this allows us to adopt the setup for new lens barrels easily.;0;2018;6

The substitution of metallic reinforcement layers in the multi layered structure by thermoplastic fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) presents a solution for self-weight issues of especially long pipes, as FRP materials display high specific strength and modulus while being resistant to external pressure and corrosion. The production of these layers is automated by the laser assisted tape winding process without the need of additional curing steps. During the manufacturing process, several data like process temperature and consolidation pressure are continuously monitored by non-contact sensors to ensure process stability without 'interfering in the consolidation process. To gain additional information about the temperature distribution within the multi-layered laminate, contact temperature sensors were introduced in the tape winding process. By this method the temperature of subjacent tapes can be assessed during the continued winding process. Additionally, this paper features a new approach of utilizing winding path data for relating the time-dependent sensor data to the exact position on the produced part. The visualization of path-dependent sensor data opens up possibilities of linking quality monitoring results to manufacturing insufficiencies and potential part defects.;0;2018;9

At the same time, the production planners face a major challenge while integrating vehicle bodies-in-white. In contrast to the original concept and rough planning state, the automated production plants are continuously optimized during the detail planning phase as well as after the start of production as a result of improved processes and model upgrading. For fast integration of new vehicles, a current digital image of the real production plant - the so-called Digital Twin is groundbreaking. This Digital Twin of a factory consists of a current bill of resources for cost calculation and a current layout planning state. The paper describes a concept for creating a Digital Twin of a body-in-white production system for the concept and rough planning projects. In the internal concept planning phase, planners do cost calculations and layouts for ordering factory suppliers. However, for integration planning, the original concept and rough planning project have to be updated. Therefore, a new concept has been developed which uses current information from the cyber-physical system and a current 3D scan to update the bill of resources and the layout planning on demand.;1;2018;8

Since this allocation is influenced by internal and external dynamic factors, in order to be responsive, production systems must possess real-time data-drive integration. The attainment of this kind of integration entails relevant praxis and scientific challenges. In this context, this paper proposes an adaptive simulation-based optimization framework for productive resources scheduling which takes advantage of forthcoming data transparency derived from the application of digital factory concept. The proposed framework was applied in a test case based on a production line of a Brazilian automotive parts supplier. The outcomes substantiate the applicability of adaptive simulation-based optimization approaches for dealing with real-world scheduling problems. Furthermore, potential improvements on the management of dynamic production systems derived from the application of digital factory concept are also identified.;1;2018;7

The actual structural condition of existing marine platforms can often change after several years in operation due to degradation mechanisms and/or other structural changes. It is within this context, the true digital twin concept has been developed and the general idea is to create a coupling between the digital twin and measurements. The measurements are performed by Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS). This coupling facilitates a direct performance evaluation of the digital twin against measurements and most importantly creates the basis for improving the performance of the digital twin to accurately capture the actual condition of the structure, and thus become a true digital twin. The full concept of creating a true digital twin encompass novel advanced analysis methods ranging from linear system identification, expansion processes, Bayesian FE model updating, wave load calibration, quantification of uncertainties from measured data, and Risk- and Reliability Based Inspection Planning (RBI) analysis, [1].

A TAB converter with detachable AC/DC converter units controls the direction and magnitude of power flows between three ports regardless of DC or AC power. We constructed a prototype TAB converter rated at 400 V and 10 kW. We tested the power-flow control and measured the step response of the DC power when the command value of the DC power was abruptly changed. The experimental results revealed that our decoupling power-control methodology is appropriate to control the power flow of our prototype TAB converter in stand-alone operation. We also constructed an autonomous distributed power network testbed consisting of the TAB converters as network nodes and explored a digital-twin model in mutually-connected operation for developing a power flow control system of our autonomous distributed power network.;0;2018;6

Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface.

Virtual commissioning allows the programmer to test the control logic before the real hardware is available and results in a reduction of the ramp-up time. In addition, the availability of a virtual model eases quality improvement, condition monitoring, virtual training, etc. The lack of integration with other tools and uniformity in file formats is an important issue that limits the use of virtual commissioning, due to a high effort and in-depth knowledge for the construction of the digital model. This paper gives an overview of academic research on the reduction of this modelling effort. A summary of different virtual commissioning approaches is given, which points out the potential of virtual commissioning using a virtual twin. Main advantages are a reduction of commissioning time and improvement of quality. These benefits where tested by performing a small scale experiment. Results show a similar effect as found in literature. Further research is needed to indicate if these values can be extrapolated to larger automation projects and identify the most influencing parameters. 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Exponential advances in technology, increased consumer power and sharpened competition imply that companies are facing the menace of commoditization. To sustainably succeed in the market, obsolete business models have to be adapted and new business models can be developed. Differentiation and unique selling propositions through innovation as well as holistic stakeholder engagement help companies to master the transformation. To enable companies and start-ups facing the implications of digital change, a tool was created and designed specifically for this demand: the Business Model Builder. This paper investigates the process of transforming the Business Model Builder into a software-supported digitized version. The digital twin allows companies to simulate the iterative adjustment of business models to constantly changing market conditions as well as customer needs on an ongoing basis. The user can modify individual variables, understand interdependencies and see the impact on the result of the business case, i.e. earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or economic value added (EVA). The simulation of a business models accordingly provides the opportunity to generate a dynamic view of the business model where any changes of input variables are considered in the result, the business case.

Ever-increasing system design complexity also increased the necessity for more stringent testing and integration capabilities of these new topologies. Real-time simulators can be very useful tools to test, validate and integrate these complex devices. Maintenance and subsystem upgrades, common issues in such complex systems, cannot be easily done on the real systems, especially on larger systems like those in navy ships. This is when a real-time digital replica with Hardware-In-the-Loop capability is very useful. This type of system is also known as a 'Digital Twin'. This approach is compatible with model-based design; a design philosophy that is based entirely on simulation models, from the specifications to release and field commissioning. In this paper, we describe the Digital Twin approach and explain it in the context of navy ships.

Drilling automation tomorrow is all about exploiting the current state of technologies available to the entire operation of drilling a well. Not only can drilling automation limit costs and reduce the risk to rig personnel and the environment, but they also give access to locations of considerable potential that previously have been regarded unsafe or uneconomical to operate in.

For one, testing of novel and innovative solutions is often very expensive because of non-productive rig time during implementation, trial runs and data evaluation. Also, the modern technologies require extensive R&D before on-site testing can even commence. While on land-rigs, some of these costs and risks can be greatly minimized, many offshore solutions lack that luxury. This paper presents an overview of the design principles that go into the construction of a fully autonomous laboratory-scale drilling rig at the University of Stavanger. It aims at describing 1) the engineering principles involved to resemble full-scale drilling operations on the laboratory scale, 2) design considerations and components, 3) component requirements for the rig, 4) control system algorithms for real-time optimization of drilling parameters and detection and handling of drilling anomalies, 5) development of drilling models (drill string dynamics, bit-vibration, etc.) and 6) benefits and future work with the laboratory-scale system. Some of the concepts that are presented in this paper have yet to be implemented during 2018. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Realizing the digital thread requires the integration of semantically-rich, open standards to facilitate the dynamic creation of context based on multiple viewpoints. This research develops such an approach to link as-planned (ISO 6983) to as-fabricated (MTConnect) product data using dynamic time warping.

IFF has therefore developed the concept of the Matrix Fusion Factory (MFF). MFF fuses the standardized coordinate system developed by IFF with the real factory, thus linking physical factories with their digital images. It is based on modularized, mobile machines capable of configuring and positioning themselves according to the tasks and context concerned. The necessary information, such as machine areas or work instructions, is gathered practically in realtime depending on location, time, order and equipment, and made available within the factory in a context-based manner In the MFF, this information is considered as being part of the physical factory. This allows the impact of the available information on the production system to be identified and simulated and, the availability of information to be adjusted. This mutual dependence between the physical and the digital factory can only be achieved through fusion. The end-result is a digital-physical factory that enables efficient and flexible value-adding processes in modularized mobile factories. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.;0;2018;6
S;"Holters, M; Dirks, S; Stollenwerk, J; Loosen, P";Automated and model-based assembly of an anamorphic telescope;"model-based assembly; tolerance; automated assembly; digital twin; optical systems";Since the first usage of optical glasses there has been an increasing demand for optical systems which are highly customized for a wide field of applications. To meet the challenge of the production of so many unique systems, the development of new techniques and approaches has risen in importance. However, the assembly of precision optical systems with lot sizes of one up to a few tens of systems is still dominated by manual labor. In contrast, highly adaptive and model-based approaches may offer a solution for manufacturing with a high degree of automation and high throughput while maintaining high precision. In this work a model-based automated assembly approach based on ray-tracing is presented. This process runs autonomously, and accounts for a wide range of functionality. It firstly identifies the sequence for an optimized assembly and secondly, generates and matches intermediate figures of merit to predict the overall optical functionality of the optical system. This process also takes into account the generation of a digital twin of the optical system, by mapping key-performance-indicators like the first and the second momentum of intensity into the optical model. This approach is verified by the automatic assembly of an anamorphic telescope within an assembly cell. By continuous measuring and mapping the key-performance-indicators into the optical model, the quality of the digital twin is determined. Moreover, by measuring the optical quality and geometrical parameters of the telescope, the precision of this approach is determined. Finally, the productivity of the process is evaluated by monitoring the speed of the different steps of the process.;0;2018;10

Multiphysics modeling together with data-driven analytics generate a new paradigm called ""Digital Twin."" The digital twin is actually a living model of the physical asset or system, which continually adapts to operational changes based on the collected online data and information, and can forecast the future of the corresponding physical counterpart. This paper reviews the overall framework to develop a digital twin coupled with the industrial Internet of Things technology to advance aerospace platforms autonomy. Data fusion techniques particularly play a significant role in the digital twin framework. The flow of information from raw data to high-level decision making is propelled by sensor-to-sensor, sensor-to-model, and model-to-model fusion.

S;"Prochnau, M; Holzbrink, M; Wang, WX; Holters, M; Stollenwerk, J; Loosen, P";Measurement methods to build up the digital optical twin;"Digital optical twin; MTF; Zernike-polynomials; Characterization; Measurement";The realization of the Digital Optical Twin (DOT), which is in short the digital representation of the physical state of an optical system, is particularly useful in the context of an automated assembly process of optical systems. During the assembly process, the physical system status of the optical system is continuously measured and compared with the digital model. In case of deviations between physical state and the digital model, the latter one is adapted to match the physical state. To reach the goal described above, in a first step measurement/characterization technologies concerning their suitability to generate a precise digital twin of an existing optical system have to be identified and evaluated. This paper gives an overview of possible characterization methods and, finally, shows first results of evaluated, compared methods (e.g. spot-radius, MTF, Zernike-polynomials), to create a DOT. The focus initially lies on the unequivocalness of the optimization results as well as on the computational time required for the optimization to reach the characterized system state. Possible sources of error are the measurement accuracy (to characterize the system), execution time of the measurement, time needed to map the digital to the physical world (optimization step) as well as interface possibilities to integrate the measurement tool into an assembly cell. Moreover, it is to be discussed whether the used measurement methods are suitable for a 'seamless' integration into an assembly cell.;0;2018;10

This concept - often referred to as Digital Twin - enables real-time geometry assurance and allows moving from mass production to more individualized production. To master the challenges of a Digital Twin for Geometry Assurance the project Smart Assembly 4.0 gathers Swedish researchers within product development, automation, virtual manufacturing, control theory, data analysis and machine learning. The vision of Smart Assembly 4.0 is the autonomous, self-optimizing robotized assembly factory, which maximizes quality and throughput, while keeping flexibility and reducing cost, by a sensing, thinking and acting strategy. The concept is based on active part matching and self-adjusting equipment which improves geometric quality without tightening the tolerances of incoming parts. The goal is to assemble products with higher quality than the incoming parts. The concept utilizes information about individual parts to be joined (sensing), selects the best combination of parts (thinking) and adjust locator positions, clamps, weld/rivet positions and sequences (acting). The project is ongoing, and this paper specifies and highlights the infrastructure, components and data flows necessary in the Digital Twin in order to realize Smart Assembly 4.0. The framework is generic, but the paper focuses on a spot weld station where two robots join two sheet metal parts in an adjustable fixture.;0;2018;7

The Digital Twin for geometry assurance is created together with the product and the production systems in early design phases. When full production starts, the purpose of the Digital Twin turns towards optimization of the geometrical quality by small changes in the assembly process. To reach its full potential, the Digital Twin concept is depending on high quality input data. In line with Internet of Things and Big Data, the problem is rather to extract appropriate data than to find data. In this paper, an inspection strategy serving the Digital Twin is given.

The webs are sandwich composite structures which are supposed to carry the shear loads coming from the wind pressure and the holes are necessary for non-structural requirements of the wind turbine. The shear webs are strong structures and it is tough to test them to failure in the lab. Hence a structural representative component with lesser dimensions has been tested in the lab to accommodate the capability of the test machines. However, this component test results cannot be directly used in the wind turbine blade structural verification as the web size is much larger in real life. A finite element model is developed to simulate the test specimen and its failure behavior. The concept in this modelling approach is to prepare a digital copy of the actual specimen which will follow the same load-displacement behavior and can predict the same failure as seen in the test coupon. The finite element model is verified for failure using known failure criteria for composite sandwich structures as well as with analytical calculations. This makes sure that the finite element model is a good 'digital twin' and simulates the test component behavior one to one. Later, this finite element model is extended to the size of the actual web structure (a family of FE models with different dimensions) to scale up the failure prediction to actual stiffness level.;0;2018;5

Properties with a predefined and standardized meaning are one pillar of such an information exchange. Another pillar is the exchange of information about relationships between semantic entities by an appropriate system description metamodel. In this paper, we focus on the information exchange of property value expressions. Within the last years, domain-specific lists of properties have been standardized. The development was driven by the need to exchange information of industrial products electronically. The standardized lists allow an unambiguous characterization of products. Results of this comprehensive work done by the standardization committees within the last years are, for example, the international standard series IEC 61360CDD, IEC 61987, and the property library eCl@ss. In these standards, thousands of properties of technical assets are semantically defined. An intuitive and general concept to use these standardized properties for information exchange is crucial for the future system design. One recent approach is the so-called property value statement model. In this paper, the basic concepts of this approach are presented. Additionally, methods to reason about property information in a general way are discussed. The presented concepts fit to the standardized property definition models and build a platform for a metadata-based information handling in the digital factory.;2;2017;9

Therefore, we can use an information system to integrate and manage all information related to product, process and simulation in this context. But with this huge amount of information, an actor of product development process may be confused about making a good decision at this particular stage. Thus, there is a lack of knowledge capitalization and sharing between product development process actors.

J;"Fang, W; Zheng, LY; Xu, JX";Self-contained optical-inertial motion capturing for assembly planning in digital factory;"Motion capture; Optical inertial fusion; Assembly planning; Human-centered assembly; Digital factory";In assembly activities, performing assembly planning is a crucial issue for the human-centered manufacturing. The challenges involve in retrieving and utilizing the real-time data about human-based work activities in a shop floor. Instead of the simulation-based assembly planning, the marker-based motion capture system can acquire realistic motion data of workers in assembling sites, but this method is inclined to corrupt due to the occlusion and is troublesome to be installed within the shop floor. Therefore, based on the complement of the optical and inertial sensor, this paper presents a self-contained motion capture method for assembly planning in real shop floor. It can provide a real-time and portable motion capturing for workers, avoiding the failure of traditional outside-in motion capture system due to occlusions or incorrect installations. What is more, the portable motion capture method can run on consumer mobile devices, providing a convenient and low-cost way to perceive the workers' motion in shop floor, which is significant for extensive applications in assembly verification and planning for digital factories. Finally, experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed motion capture method for assembly activities.;2;2017;14

These important attributes are now optimized by trial and error because the essential process variables cannot currently be selected from scientific principles. A recourse is to build and rigorously validate a digital twin of the additive manufacturing process that can provide accurate predictions of the spatial and temporal variations of metallurgical parameters that affect the structure and properties of components. Key building blocks of a computationally efficient first-generation digital twin of laser-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing utilize a transient, three-dimensional model that calculates temperature and velocity fields, cooling rates, solidification parameters and deposit geometry. The measured profiles of stainless steel 316L and Alloy 800H deposits as well as the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and Vickers hardness measurements are used to validate the proposed digital twin. The predicted cooling rates, temperature gradients, solidification rates, SDAS and micro-hardness values are shown to be more accurate than those obtained from a commonly used heat conduction calculation. These metallurgical building blocks serve as a phenomenological framework for the development of a digital twin that will make the expanding knowledge base of additive manufacturing usable in a practical way for all scientists and engineers.

Virtual planning has been prevailed as a method used to evaluate risks and costs before the concrete realization of production processes. The process of product assembly, which yields a high share in total production costs, gets its particular importance. This paper introduces a new approach and its initial implementation for knowledge-based design for assembly in agile manufacturing by using data mining (DM) methods in the field of series production with high variance. The approach adopts the usage of bulk data with old, successful designs in order to extrapolate its scope for assembly processes. Especially linked product and process data allow the innovative usage of DM methods in order to facilitate the front loading in the product development. The concept presents an affordable assistance potential for development of new products variants along the product emergence process (PEP). With this approach an early cost estimation of assembly processes in series production can be conducted using advanced DM methods as shown in an industrial use case. Furthermore, design and planning processes can be supported effectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;11;2017;15

This is the case of data collected by Web analytics tools, which describe the way users interact with Web contents and where their attention focuses onto during navigation. Given the complexity of information to analyze, existing tools often make use of visualization strategies to represent data aggregated throughout separate sessions and multiple users. In particular, heat maps are often adopted to study the distribution of mouse activity and identify page regions that are more frequently reached during interaction. Unfortunately, since Web contents are accessed via ever more heterogeneous devices, region-based heat maps cannot be exploited anymore to aggregate data concerning user's attention, since the same Web content may move to another page location or exhibit a different aspect depending on the access device used or the user agent setup. This paper presents the design of a visual analytics framework capable to deal with the above limitation by adopting a data collection approach that combines information about regions displayed with information about page structure. This way, the well-known heat map-based visualization can be produced, where interactions can be aggregated on a per-element basis independently of the specific access configuration. Experimental results showed that the framework succeeds in accurately quantifying user's attention and replicating results obtained by manual processing.;3;2017;11

The investigation was performed using emm typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, superantigen profiling, and genome analysis. This enabled characterization of relatedness among the outbreak isolates and identification of the mobile genetic elements present. Among 57 patients with respiratory symptoms investigated in the factory, emm5 GAS strains were isolated from 8 patients. The eight GAS infection cases comprising one fatal severe pneumonia case, six influenza-like illness cases, and one pharyngitis case. Two risk factors were identified: adult with an age of 18-20 years and close contact with a GAS patient or carrier. GAS attack rate was 14.0% (8/57), and GAS carriage rate was probably around 2.7% (14/521) based on surveys in two nearby districts. All the 10 outbreak associated isolates were assigned to emm5 and sequence type ST-99 (emm5/ST-99), harbored superantigen genes speC, speG, and smeZ, and were assigned to two similar PFGE patterns (clones). Among the outbreak associated isolates, all carried ermA with resistance to erythromycin and inducible resistance to clindamycin, and eight (80%) carried a tetM gene with resistance to tetracycline. Among the 14 carriage isolates, 12 were emm12/ST-36, and 2 were emm1/ST-28, all with superantigen genes speC, speG, ssa, and smeZ. All the carriage isolates harbored ermB and tetM with resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. Genome analysis showed the two outbreak clones were closely related and possessed new prophages carrying virulence gene sdc and antibiotic resistance genes of ermA and tetM, which were not found in the emm5 reference strain Manfredo. This is the first report of a GAS outbreak in this type of workplace. The outbreak was caused by two closely related emm5 clones that differed from the predominant emm types circulating in China.;2;2017;10
J;"Sarigecili, MI; Roy, U; Rachuri, S";Enriching STEP Product Model With Geometric Dimension and Tolerance Information for One-Dimensional Tolerance Analysis;;Information exchange and sharing become a necessity for digital factory but they have been more challenging as the industry is computerized more. This is mainly because the capabilities of computerized systems have grown significantly in a very rapid pace in their own information structure, and they require to retrieve various data from different computer systems. ISO 10303-STEP has been developed to provide a neutral format for exchanging product data. However, implementation of STEP has several issues, including the following two: (1) the complete STEP file should be processed even for querying a small set of data, and (2) information required for realizing any functional activity (e.g., any analysis on any part of a product) is not explicitly identified. Hence, in this study, functionality-based conformance classes (FCCs) are developed to organize the current conformance classes (CCs) (which are the classes required to be implemented fully in order to be conformant to any particular STEP standard) for supporting different functional activities. Following the concept of data exchange specification (DEX)/template, several templates that are repeatedly used small information groups are introduced in order to create manageable sets of data constructs. In this study, the FCCs for 1D tolerance analysis are developed by enriching the available STEP information models with GD&T. The use of extended STEP models is illustrated with a case study.;0;2017;10

J;"Yerra, VA; Pilla, S";IIoT-Enabled Production System for Composite Intensive Vehicle Manufacturing;;The advancements in automation, big data computing and high bandwidth networking has expedited the realization of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT has made inroads into many sectors including automotive, semiconductors, electronics, etc. Particularly, it has created numerous opportunities in the automotive manufacturing sector to realize the new aura of platform concepts such as smart material flow control. This paper provides a thought provoking application of IIoT in automotive composites body shop. By creating a digital twin for every physical part, we no longer need to adhere to the conventional manufacturing processes and layouts, thus opening up new opportunities in terms of equipment and space utilization. The century-old philosophy of the assembly line might not be the best layout for vehicle manufacturing, thus proposing a novel assembly grid layout inspired from a colony of ants working to accomplish a common goal. Value added time per part are compared between the traditional and proposed manufacturing process layout using virtual plant simulation tools. This value added time is directly proportional to operating and capital cost. Moreover, the study proposes real-time multilayer communication that has the potential to vastly improves tasks such as inventory management, proactive/preventive maintenance, inline quality control, flexibility to part variabilities and design development.;0;2017;6
J;"Li, CZ; Mahadevan, S; Ling, Y; Choze, S; Wang, LP";Dynamic Bayesian Network for Aircraft Wing Health Monitoring Digital Twin;;"Current airframe health monitoring generally relies on deterministic physics models and ground inspections. This paper uses the concept of a dynamic Bayesian network to build a versatile probabilistic model for diagnosis and prognosis in order to realize the digital twin vision, and it illustrates the proposed method by an aircraft wing fatigue crack growth example. The dynamic Bayesian network integrates physics models and various aleatory (random) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainty sources in crack growth prediction. In diagnosis, the dynamic Bayesian network is used to track the evolution of the time-dependent variables and calibrate the time-independent variables; in prognosis, the dynamic Bayesian network is used for probabilistic prediction of crack growth in the future. This paper also proposes a modification to the dynamic Bayesian network structure, which does not affect the diagnosis results but reduces the time cost significantly by avoiding Bayesian updating with load data. By using a particle filter as the Bayesian inference algorithm for the dynamic Bayesian network, the proposed approach handles both discrete and continuous variables of various distribution types, as well as nonlinear relationships between nodes. Challenges in implementing the particle filter in the dynamic Bayesian network, where 1) both dynamic and static nodes exist and 2) a state variable may have parent nodes across two adjacent networks, are also resolved.";9;2017;12

A holistic approach that considers a robotic cell as a whole toward minimizing energy consumption is proposed. The mathematical model, which takes into account various robot speeds, positions, power-saving modes, and alternative orders of operations, can be transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming formulation that is, however, suitable only for small instances. To optimize complex robotic cells, a hybrid heuristic accelerated by using multicore processors and the Gurobi simplex method for piecewise linear convex functions is implemented. The experimental results showed that the heuristic solved 93% of instances with a solution quality close to a proven lower bound. Moreover, compared with the existing works, which typically address problems with three to four robots, this study solved real-size problem instances with up to 12 robots and considered more optimization aspects. The proposed algorithms were also applied on an existing robotic cell in Skoda Auto. The outcomes, based on simulations and measurements, indicate that, compared with the previous state (at maximal robot speeds and without deeper power-saving modes), the energy consumption can be reduced by about 20% merely by optimizing the robot speeds and applying power-saving modes. All the software and generated datasets used in this research are publicly available.;13;2017;11

For this purpose, they use control systems that monitor and influence the process with the help of sensors and actuators. Changing control values or (physical) disturbances are recorded and considered by the control systems. Problems arise whenever the disturbances are not physical, but organizational. In these cases, the existing control systems can not react and there are delays and failures in the system process. New trends in automation and information and communication technology can help to bridge this gap in process control by providing intelligent and data-based services in the immediate process environment. Distributed drive systems can assume a key role as they already have the necessary technical requirements. However, these are to be made more flexible. For this purpose, it is necessary to subject both hardware and software production to a systemic approach and to provide the mechanical part of the system process with a digital image. The fact that this increases the complexity in the system production is undisputed. Therefore, in addition to the technical possibilities for solving the problem, the value in use must also be determined and evaluated from the outset in system development.;0;2017;6

S;"Yun, S; Park, JH; Kim, WT";Data-centric Middleware based Digital Twin Platform for Dependable Cyber-Physical Systems;"Communication Middleware; Digital twin; CPS; Modeling&Simulation; ADAS";the concept of digital twin, a kind of virtual things with the precise states of the corresponding physical systems, is suggested by industrial domains to accurately estimate the status and predict the operation of machines. Digital twin can be used for development of critical systems, such as self-driving cars and auto-production factories. There, however, will be so different digital twins in terms of resolution, complexity, modelling languages and formats. It is required to cooperate heterogeneous digital twins in standardized ways. Since a centralized digital twin system uses too big resources and energies, it is preferable to make large-scale digital twin system geographically and logically distributed over the Internet. In addition, efficient interworking functions between digital twins and the physical systems are required also. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of large-scale digital twin platform including distributed digital twin cooperation framework, flexible data-centric communication middleware, and the platform based digital twin application to develop a reliable advanced driver assistance system.;5;2017;5
S;"Uhlemann, THJ; Lehmann, C; Steinhilper, R";The Digital Twin: Realizing the Cyber-Physical Production System for Industry 4.0;"cyber-physical production systems; multimodal data acquisition; digital twin; production system optimization; Industry 4.0";Concerning current approaches to planning of manufacturing processes, the acquisition of a sufficient data basis of the relevant process information and subsequent development of feasible layout options requires 74 % of the overall time-consumption. However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a realtime generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises.

This term is more and more used in industry and research initiatives; however, the scientific literature does not provide a unique definition of this concept. The paper aims at analyzing the definitions of the DT concept in scientific literature, retracing it from the initial conceptualization in the aerospace field, to the most recent interpretations in the manufacturing domain and more specifically in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing research. DT provides virtual representations of systems along their lifecycle. Optimizations and decisions making would then rely on the same data that are updated in real-time with the physical system, through synchronization enabled by sensors.

The digitization of production systems offers the possibility of automated data acquisition. Nevertheless, approaches concerning fully automated data acquisition systems are not widely spread among SME (small and medium sized enterprises). On the one hand, this is caused by the heterogeneous databases, on the other hand by insufficient data processing systems. Furthermore, the advantages of The Digital Twin are not sufficiently known due to the lack of competence in SME concerning matters of Industry 4.0. In order to transfer knowledge about the benefits of digitalization, the development of demonstrating platforms is crucial. This paper introduces a learning factory based concept to demonstrate the potentials and advantages of real time data acquisition and subsequent simulation based data processing. Therefore, an existing learning factory will be upgraded regarding both, multi-modal data acquisition technologies as well as a locally independent optimization environment. Thereby the requirements of SME concerning flexible, easy to use, scalable and service oriented digitization applications are met. The approach is part of a concept for the realization of a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) in SME that ensures the development of an image of the production with the aid of a multi-modal data acquisition.

J;"Francalanza, E; Borg, J; Constantinescu, C";A knowledge-based tool for designing cyber physical production systems;"Digital factory; Industry 4.0; Decision making";Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer's cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.

This new methodology complements traditional methodologies of shadow economy estimation with such a component as digital shadow economy. Our analysis of the most popular today methods of shadow economic estimation proves that, despite some of its drawbacks, the MIMIC model can be treated as the most comprehensive and appropriate method for such calculations since it takes into account both causal and indicators of shadow economy. As the causal variables here, as applied to digital shadow economy, we use household access to the Internet and IT overall, the volume of non-cash payments and the use of most advanced financial instruments. While as the indicators of the digital shadow economy spread we use: the volume of non-cash payments at online platforms, the frequency of cryptocurrency payments, and the cost of parcels to which customs duties have not been applied. For further empirical verification of the model proposed here, numerical values of both causal variables and indicators would be necessary. Unfortunately, official statistical sources are unable to provide such data in full volume, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies and other informal payments. Thus, in our further research we plan to not only prove the practical applicability of the offered here model for estimations of digital shadow economy size as well as overall size of shadow economy on the examples of particular countries, but also to accumulate the necessary statistics for such calculations.;0;2017;14

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the B ayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems. Later, we present a telematics-based prototype driving assistance application for the vehicular domain of C2PS, VCPS, to demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture reference model.;49;2017;13

At the same time, various national manufacturing development strategies have been put forward, such as Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet, manufacturing based on Cyber-Physical System, and Made in China 2025.

Accordingly, a novel concept of digital twin shop-floor (DTS) based on digital twin is explored and its four key components are discussed, including physical shop-floor, virtual shop-floor, shop-floor service system, and shop-floor digital twin data. What is more, the operation mechanisms and implementing methods for DTS are studied and key technologies as well as challenges ahead are investigated, respectively.;44;2017;10

The real-world complexity and the role of PLM in a company are hard to explain to students, particularly in an abstract university environment. In fact, only few students manage to build a link between the abstract theory and the daily challenges of companies. Linking the reality with commonly accepted theory and new aspects from research requires a model that can showcase how theory works in real world, but is simple enough to be explained in a reasonable amount of time. To achieve this goal in education, a scenario around a product in its eco-system has been created. Physically, it is built on very common and easy to use technologies (Lego, Arduino, 3D printed parts). Yet, all relevant organizational aspects, processes, and IT tools are present as in a modern, up-to-date company (ERP, PLM, Configurator, CAD, etc.). This allows to understand the different aspects of PLM based on a hands-on example. For instance, it is possible to explain and experience the impact of an assemble-to-order strategy on engineering, the sales department, service, and the assembly line, by actually doing it. This paper discusses a novel approach in the education of PLM that addresses students, but also people from industry. Eventually, the educational model also serves as a platform to discuss real world problems with industry and discuss and test new approaches (digitization, industry 4.0) and their impact along the lifecycle of their product.;0;2017;11

Indeed, a true reflection of the real factory can be exploited to monitor and simulate the factory performance, allowing to adjust and optimize processes, anticipate failures and also investigate problems. One of the major challenge to be tackled in order to realize the Digital Twin is the handling of the factory telemetry, which can track the evolution of the objects in the real world. This paper investigates the potential of an application for supporting and handling the factory telemetry, thus allowing to create a snapshot of the real system that can dynamically augment and enhance the data-driven simulation applications supporting the manufacturing execution phase. As a proof of concept of the architecture, a prototype has been developed in the field of robotics.

The European Commission's initiative on Digitizing European Industry, adopted on 19 April 2016, represents one of the most important measures assumed in the latest years at the European level. However, the last places that Romania has constantly occupied both in the European digitization and competitiveness rankings, should represent a big concern for Romanian authorities and its public policies. The gaps between objectives and results related to digitization process and competitiveness are very high and impose rapid and determined policy measures. The paper provides a brief overview of the current EU evolutions in the field of digitization process either from legislative, institutional and output perspectives. On the other hand, the paper focuses on the significant gaps between estimated and real results recorded by Romania in terms of economy digitization, in order to identify the main deficiencies of the country's digitization strategies and policies. This comparison intends to provide a clear picture of the Romanian's position in the field of digitization in order to respond to the secondary objective of the paper - increasing the awareness of public decision makers on this topic. The paper concludes that, taking into account, on one hand, the fact that the digitalization reality covers the entire world, proving a high degree of dynamism that imposes rapid and constant adaptation to these new realities and, on the other hand, the low national scores recorded by the Romanian digitization process, the Romanian public authorities must reanalyze its specific digital strategies and policies and better exploit the main threats and the opportunities provided by the current European and global context.;0;2017;15

Often the integration of human personnel in this kind of automated planning, control and execution of production processes is combined with an assumption of tasks by the computer system and thereby degradation of employees. The interconnection and negotiation among the devices open up possibilities for a new kind of integration of human employees interacting in such a technically autonomously working environment. This paper presents an approach, where a digital twin is developed, which assumes the communication and coordination tasks of the employee with the production system and acts as a representative.

Through learning and exchange of spatiotemporal information with the city, enabled through virtualization and the connectivity offered by Internet of Things (IoT), this Digital Twin of the city becomes smarter over time, able to provide predictive insights into the city's smarter performance and growth.;0;2017;5
B;"Bilal, B; Ahmed, S; Kakkar, V";Multifunction Reversbile Logic Gate: Logic Synthesis and Design Implementation in QCA;"QCA; quantum dots; nanotechnology; reversible computing; logic synthesis; clocking";Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a newly developed paradigm for digital design. It explains how computation can be performed using nano sized quantum dots. One of the trending application of QCA is the design of reversible logic circuits and gates. Reversible logic is a dissipation less digital logic. According to this logic digital circuitry with almost zero power dissipation can be designed. The most important application of reversible logic is quantum computing. Quantum Computation cannot be performed without the use of reversible circuits. A number of reversible gates have been designed and used in quantum computing. The best way to derive the maximum out of reversible computation is to design those gates and circuits using systems which are inherently reversible. This is true for the quantum mechanical systems. For this quantum level designing Quantum-dot Cellular Automata stands as the appropriate choice. It's a nano level based archetype. Performing multiple functions using single circuits has always been the aim of the digital industry researchers. In reversible logic the approach is developing towards designing multifunction gates that can perform a number of functions using a same circuit with some adjustments. This development has however not yet been explored much in QCA. In this paper the majority logic equations for the outputs of a multifunction reversible logic gate are derived and the novel Quantum-dot Cellular Automata design is proposed. Some of the functions of multifunction reversible logic gate are discussed and simulated results using QCA Designer 2.0.3 are shown in the figure.;0;2017;6

S;"Rahm, J; Graube, M; Urbas, L";A proposal for an interactive roundtrip engineering system;;During the life cycle of an industrial processing plant, a variety of domain specific data models are generated. All these models will be changed independently by a group of engineers over time. Maintaining the consistency of these models involves a time consuming and costly manual process. Here we introduce an interactive roundtrip engineering system for processing industry environments. The system use a complementary rule-based transformation language to provide generation and synchronisation processes. For this, an interactive concept is presented with a knowledge-based system and user interaction. The goal is to have a consistent digital twin of the plant through the whole life cycle in a highly automated manner. This leads to a traceable transformation process which ensures more parallel design phases and an efficient maintenance or reconstruction of the digital plant twin.;0;2017;7

J;"Heinzerling, T; Oppelt, M; Bell, T";Integration of device models into the process simulation - concept and evaluation of a model description;"device models; virtual commissioning; digital twin for process plants";The suppliers of automation solutions for process plants face increasing demands concerning complexity, plant safety, and shorter project completion deadlines. One possible way to meet these demands is the comprehensive use of simulation methods over the complete lifecycle of the plant. This enables an early validation of solution concepts and the identification of faults before the real plant is available. In addition to a comprehensive modelling of the actual plant, it is also important to consider the behaviour and properties of the individual devices (such as sensors and actuators) that are installed in the plant, because these have a significant impact on the overall behaviour of the plant. This article describes a concept for the creation and integration of simulation models for field devices, including a proof-of-concept implementation of the cyclic and acyclic communications behaviour. In addition, detailed device models have been created that also cover product specific properties and functions. The aim is to enable suppliers to create simulation models for their own devices.;0;2017;12

""Anything as a service"" has become the key principle of the digital paradigm. This is about a data-oriented service which relies on sharing information resources (including public ones) and the requirements for interoperability, security and trust. This paper presents the main approaches to digital transformation based on the example of the most innovatively active sectors such as banking and healthcare. We compare the proprietary development of digital services (products) to the building of a digital sector ecosystem aimed at attracting an unlimited number of participants. We defined the purpose of creating an ecosystem that is to provide the population with digital services formed on demand, in real time, in compliance with legislation and regulations, as well as in the context of maximum trust. We emphasize the role of openness for uniting the efforts of the community interested in the development of a digital industry, extension of public-private partnerships and building a competitive environment in order to ensure the rapid growth of available digital services, as well as to improve their quality. Since the knowledge economy is the basis for the digital economy, the authors consider it especially important to form a semantic core which acts as the carrier of knowledge in a digital sector ecosystem. We confirmed the necessity to implement the semantic core by a brief analysis of modern semantic approaches to standardization of information sharing in the above-mentioned industries, such as FIBO, BIAN (banking), HL7 and UMLS (health). The research carried out allowed the authors to design the conceptual architecture of the ecosystem and to suggest several proposals for digital transformation of an industry.

This digital twin can reduce the complexity of reconfiguration by early detection of design or process sequence flaws in the system during virtual commissioning. A prerequisite is a current virtual plant model of the structured, mechatronic resource components of the real plant during the different phases of its life cycle. This article discusses the cross-domain mechatronic data structure of the virtual manufacturing cells in the automotive industry in the context of RAMI 4.0.

To cope with the need, recent literature has successfully shown modular production and assembly line concepts by using standardized interfaces on electromechanical and communication level.

Scientific challenges in the field of Industry 4.0 and intra-logistics are identified due to the new form of interaction between humans and machines. This kind of collaboration provides new possibilities of materials handling that can be developed with the support of real-time motion data tracking and virtual reality systems. These services will be provided by a new research centre for flexible humanmachine cooperation networks in Dortmund. By the use of various reference and experiment systems various real-time scenarios can be emulated including digital twin simulation concepts.

Under the individualized designing demands, more realistic virtual models mirroring the real worlds of production lines are essential to bridge the gap between design and operation. This paper presents a digital twin-based approach for rapid individualized designing of the hollow glass production line. The digital twin merges physics-based system modeling and distributed real-time process data to generate an authoritative digital design of the system at pre-production phase.

Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop e-machine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine pilot assembly line, is being supported by a set of virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a CPS using an e-machine assembly station as a case study. The main contribution of the work is to further validate the CPS philosophy by extending the concept into practical applications in pilot production systems with prototype products.

This means the adaptation of a data-driven manufacturing model, which includes the horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain and the management of data across the whole product life cycle. Currently companies face two major problems in this transformation of their IT architectures: 1) There are multiple reference architectures for Industrie 4.0, whose suitability has not been evaluated in a straightforward way. 2) There are no maturity models to objectively assess data-driven IT architectures. In this work we address these problems by providing an overview of Industrie 4.0 features in multiple reference architectures and developing a maturity model for IT architectures for data-driven manufacturing. We first give an overview of the current maturity models with aspects of data-driven manufacturing. Based on this overview we survey three reference architectures for Industrie 4.0: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0, and the Stuttgart IT Architecture for Manufacturing.

S;"Horvath, G; Erdos, G";Gesture control of cyber physical systems;"gesture control; cyber physical system; human robot collaboration";The next generation of robots should be able to work well in the presence of human operators safely without posing potential life hazard. To realize the collaborative and symbiotic work of humans and robots, it is essential to use a convenient interface that is natural for humans. The design of the interface must consider ergonomic aspects and must not hinder the work of the operator. The interface have to be unambiguous for both the robot and human operator. In this article, we present a control for cyber physical systems. In order to properly interpret and execute commands in a human-robot shared workspace, it is essential to have a virtual model, where commanded actions can be justified from feasibility and safety point of view. This is established by implementing the digital twin of the robot cell. This virtual model contains both the model of the robot and the human operator. The controller allows simultaneous control of robots, both the actual machines and the models in cyber-space, as well as updating the posture and gestures of the human operator. The implemented gesture control language is modular. Modularization creates the opportunity to reconfigure the cell with minimal energy expenditure and still use the same gestures, in order to realize different production use-cases.

The factory coordinate system merges the digital image of the factory (digital shadow) with the real production process practically in realtime and independent of scale. To achieve this, diverse data acquisition systems are grouped into a classification system on the basis of the degree of accuracy required; depending on the degree of resolution, the data collected is then merged chronologically in a standardized coordinate system according to time. The resulting digital shadow of the complete production plant enables the complexity of tasks in the system to be reduced. Any decisions that need to be made in the near future can be aided by performing centralized or decentralized simulations with realtime data. This enables systems to be adapted to new restrictions faster and more cost-effectively. By projecting the digital shadow onto the real production system, any discrepancies are identified immediately, any problems rectified and downtimes reduced even before they arise. This strengthens and safeguards the competitiveness of networked factories in the future. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.";1;2017;8

Nowadays increasingly intelligent, individualized products encourages companies to respond innovatively to customer requirements and to handle the rising product variations quickly. An integrated engineering network, spanning across the entire value chain, is operated to intelligently connect various company divisions, and to generate a business ecosystem for products, services and communities. The conditions for the digital twin are thereby determined in which the digital world can be fed into the real, and the real world back into the digital to deal such intelligent products with rising variations. The term digital twin can be described as a digital copy of a real factory, machine, worker etc., that is created and can be independently expanded, automatically updated as well as being globally available in real time. Every real product and production site is permanently accompanied by a digital twin. First prototypes of such digital twins already exist in the ESB Logistics Learning Factory on a cloud- and app-based software that builds on a dynamic, multidimensional data and information model. A standardized language of the robot control systems via software agents and positioning systems has to be integrated. The aspect of the continuity of the real factory in the digital factory as an economical means of ensuring continuous actuality of digital models looks as the basis of changeability. For the indoor localization sensor combinations that in addition to the hardware already contain the software required for the sensor data fusion should be used. Processing systems, scenario-live-simulations and digital shop floor management results in a mandatory procedural combination.

To resolve these issues, global manufacturing enterprises and developed countries are leading the development of Smart Manufacturing System (SMS). Smart Manufacturing (SM) connects all of procurement, production, logistics, service, and product to the network, and controls the entire production processes in real-time on the basis of unified environment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS for manufacturing enables optimisation of product development and total control of production system through real-time exchange of all information required for production based on Internet of Things (IoT). In order to establish CPS in manufacturing companies, legacy systems and engineering tools need to be connected to cloud computing and IoT, and real-time information exchanges from the shop-floor level to the business level need to be enabled.

So far, this paradigm has mainly been tested for digital design and fabrication processes including the usual steps of designing an artefact with a CAD system to then have a prototype manufactured with a 3D printer. Unfortunately, a common mishap that can often be observed is that artefacts that look perfectly fine on the CAD computer screen come out severely misshaped on the 3D printer. In this paper, we first investigate and document this phenomenon and explain its root cause, which concerns a) the data transmitted to the 3D printer, b) inappropriate design features, and c) a mismatch between geometry requirements and printer capabilities. As more and more entrepreneurs, hobbyists in maker communities, and other not always fully trained individuals pursue their design and make ideas, there is a need for smart computer-based support to facilitate a successful design-to-print process. Such a digital DfM assistant might pop up to prompt a designer to modify identified critical areas of the design so that it can be printed with a chosen printer or alternatively propose another type of printer that may have the technical capabilities to accommodate the design in its current form. Acknowledging this need, we propose a two-stage smart manufacturability assistant. The first stage decomposes the digital model into a series of part features; the second stage of the model involved defining the capabilities of the 3D-printer. Finally, we begin to realize this manufacturability assistant by creating and evaluating a bespoke test part which can be used to define a machine-material capability map for an example FDM process.

Therefore, the minimization of engine operating cost per flight-hour is a key aspect for airlines to operate successfully under challenging market conditions. The interaction between maintenance cost, operating cost, asset value, lease and replacement cost describes the area of conflict in which engine fleets can be optimized. State-of-the-art fleet management is based on advanced diagnostic and prognostic methods on engine and component level to provide optimized long-term removal and work-scoping forecasts on fleet level based on the individual operation. The key element of these methods is a digital twin of the active engines consisting of multilevel models of the engine and its components. This digital twin can be used to support deterioration and failure analysis, predict life consumption of critical parts and relate the specific operation of a customer to the real and expected condition of the engines on-wing and at induction to the shop. The fleet management data is constantly updated based on operational data sent from the engines as well as line maintenance and shop data.

J;"Bohacs, G; Rinkacs, A";Development of an ontology-driven, component based framework for the implementation of adaptiveness in a Jellyfish-type simulation model;"Simulation; logistics; ontologies; adaptive systems";"Simulation modelling has an ever increasing importance for complex systems. Manufacturing and related material flow or logistic systems are typical fields of application. Latest trends such as Cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0 give a significant boost to simulation modelling as these require a digital model of the system. Complex manufacturing and related material flow systems are subject to frequent changes and pose a Big Data problem, which raises stronger requirements regarding self-adaptiveness. Conventional simulation models are to be adapted only via user interaction. Previous research steps have concentrated on the establishment of a novel simulation model structure, the so called ""Jellyfish"" model which unifies layout and process-type simulation models. Visualization of both aspects simultaneously enables interacting users to better understand the systems' operation compared to the conventional models. The current paper focuses on the adaptive capability of the new model. We have concentrated on the hardest type of adaptation, the structural adaptation. In this paper, an ontology-driven component based approach is presented and explained further through an example. Application of automated ontology-matching in simulation environment is a novel approach enabling the simulation model to adapt its structure without the necessity of manual interaction.";2;2017;14

Through cyberspaces, such as social networking platforms, alternative future currency systems, e-commerce, e-business systems or cyber computer games, real money (or an electronic equivalent of its value) circulates, but in most cases transactions are not accounted and do not generate taxes to the budget of a state. This article is aimed at supplementation of the traditional shadow economy estimation methodology with the indicator of digital shadow economy, and performance of the statistical analysis of the data which would allow to identify the areas with the highest scope of digital shadow economy. At present, the scope of shadow economy in Lithuania is estimated by employing one of the two methodologies - developed by the State Tax Inspectorate and by Lithuanian Free Market Institute. It should be noted that neither of these methodologies includes the elements of digital shadow economy. In theoretical level, no methodologies to cover any indicator of digital shadow economy with its relevant features have been developed so far. By employing the method of expert evaluation (with participation of 184 experts who work in the Department of Control, Lithuanian State Tax Inspectorate), the authors of this article initially estimated the scope of digital shadow economy and identified the areas with the highest scope of digital shadow economy in Lithuania over 2015. The research has revealed that more than a half of the experts have not inspected or identified any subjects illegally operating in e-space. The fact that the scopes of digital shadow economy have not still been estimated indeed burdens the development of any efficient mechanism, which would allow to identify and detect illegal economic activities in e-space.;5;2016;15

S;"Schuh, G; Blum, M";Design of a Data Structure for the Order Processing as a Basis for Data Analytics Methods;;Today, manufacturing companies are facing the influences of a dynamic environment and the continuously increasing planning complexity. Using advanced data analytics methods, processes can be improved by analyzing historical data, detecting patterns and deriving measures to counteract the issues. The basis of such approaches builds a virtual representation of a product called the digital twin or digital shadow. Although, applied IT systems provide reliable feedback data of the processes on the shop-floor, they lack on a data structure which represents real-time data series of a product. This paper presents an approach for a data structure for the order processing which overcomes the described issue and provides a virtual representation of a product.

J;Mangiron, C;The use of the Catalan language in the video game industry;"video games; game localisation; Catalan video games; apps in Catalan; digital industry; promotion of the use of Catalan";Video games have become one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the 21st century. Their significance in society keeps increasing due to their important social functions, such as education and health, and their presence in an array of platforms: mobile phones, tablets, PCs, and consoles. The number of languages into which games are being localised is also increasing beyond the traditional French, Italian, German and Spanish to include Polish, Portuguese, and Russian. However, speakers of minority languages, such as Catalan, do not have access to a wide selection of games in their language and often have to play in a different one. This paper presents an analysis of the position of the Catalan language in the video games industry and compares it to the situation of this language on the Internet and in the computer software industry. It describes the situation of the video game industry in Catalonia and analyses what kind of games are available in Catalan, outlining the paucity of electronic games available to Catalan players. The paper also examines the steps and measures that are being taken by the Catalan Government and the Catalan gaming community to redress this situation and provides a number of ideas about how to promote the presence of Catalan in this ever-growing area of interactive audiovisual entertainment.;0;2016;14

Increasing transfer of transactions to electronic space determines the growth of the number of illegal digital operators and promotes consumers' involvement in digital shadow trade. Scientific literature does not contain any universal definition of digital shadow economy. Hence, the variety of terms, interpretations and features relevant to this phenomenon is rather wide, which determines the necessity to define the precise concept of digital shadow economy from the point of view of consumers as active participants in this field. This article is aimed at definition of the concept of digital shadow economy from consumers' position and identification of the measures would discourage potential consumers from participation in digital shadow economy. To increase the size of the survey sample, the method of ""snowball"" was engaged. The results of the research have revealed that consumers are inclined to distinguish criminal activities (drugs, prostitution, credential steals, etc.) from illegal economic activities, which also violate established legal norms and regulations. The participants of the survey perceive that the activities of digital shadow economy are performed exceptionally in electronic space without official registration of business and evading tax payment. Participation in digital shadow economy is voluntary and mutually beneficial to both transaction parties (a trader and a consumer). With reference to the results of consumers' evaluation, definition of digital shadow activities as illegal ones, development of the efficient legal framework, containing clearly established criminal and/or administrative responsibility for a consumer as a party of digital shadow transaction, public announcement and availability of the information on illegal e-traders in e-space, availability of appropriate protection software, more intensive supervision and control, establishment of e-police department and assurance of the sufficient number of supervising officers can be considered the most efficient measures of digital shadow economy prevention.

Although, in general sense, the characteristics of the subjects, operating in digital shadow economy, are not extremely different from the ones of the subjects, operating in traditional shadow economy, the expert evaluation has enabled to identify the distinctive features of an illegal digital market seller, who can be represented as a young or middle-aged male with higher education, a professional in his operational field. With reference to the research results, sellers in digital shadow economy include the entities with officially registered activities, who are trying to evade taxation of the revenues earned from the operations in e-space. On the other hand, according to the experts, the amount of the officially accounted revenue earned by these entities may reach up to 300 EUR. Hence, the defined profile of an illegal seller, as of a subject, operating in digital shadow economy, proposes that a seller in digital shadow economy is an intellectually developed person with advanced professional skills, but insufficient financial earnings.

The common techniques of simulating the plant within Virtual Commissioning do no longer fulfil these needs, new approaches have to be developed. This paper examines ways to standardize Functional Mock-Up Unit based behaviour models of mechatronic components of such automated manufacturing plants. It is argued how such components can be classified to reach a distinction between different types to be able to develop standardized interfaces for every type. Therefore a standardized framework of how these interfaces can look like is proposed. Based on this framework as well as the classification of the components two examples, a pneumatic valve cylinder combination and an industrial robot are exemplarily implemented. Besides the standard interfaces to the control program and the visualisation of the simulation a special effort to implement energetically considerations were made. Therefore the presented work shows a way of how to standardize the interfaces of behaviour models of different classes of mechatronic components while increasing the quality of these behaviour models for more complex and accurate behaviour simulation of production plants for Virtual Commissioning as well as related applications.

A reference model, as part of the methodology, is used for clustering information in the different steps. The virtual planning model is connected with a real assembly system which allows an automatic model update, providing the planner with the latest system configuration. While operating the assembly system the connection is simultaneously used to derive a product memory which guides the product through the assembly.

The digital eco-factory has been proposed for a simultaneous examination of environmental performance, productivity and manufacturability. This paper entertains how to construct the digital eco-factory with high accuracy and usability. In general, the digital eco-factory is constructed on the virtual production line modelling an actual production line and its components. A multi-agent based construction of the digital eco-factory was applied and a trial digital eco-factory has been implemented for a PCA (Printed Circuit Assembly) line. A PCA line consists of a solder paste printer, two or three electronic part mounters, reflow soldering oven and testing machine. In the PCA line, processes for the above machines proceed in sequence, these machines' capabilities are modelled as individual machine agents. There are several types of printed boards produced, depending on the number of mounted electronic components and the temperature of the solder. When a blank PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is input to a solder paste printing machine, the production process is started. A PCB is modelled as a part agent which is one of the product agents. For some example virtual productions, power consumption of each machine on each line from the environmental view and productivity of each machine and each line are monitored. From the results of the trial implementation, it can be said that all components on the production line could be configured as software agents with required accuracy. These agents are called ""machine agents."" In addition to machine agents, manufactured products such as workpiece and parts are also configured as software agents. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The configuration of a an efficient assembly line can be supported by suitable methodologies and techniques, such as design for manufacture and assembly, assembly sequence planning, assembly line balancing, lean manufacturing and optimization techniques. In this paper, these methods are applied with reference to the industrial case study of the assembly line of a Skycar light aircraft. The assembly process sequence is identified taking into account the analysis of the assembly structure and the required precedence constraints, and diverse techniques are applied to optimize the assembly line performance. Different line configurations are verified through discrete event simulation to assess the potential increase of efficiency and throughput in a digital environment and propose the most suitable configuration of the assembly line.

S;"Buscher, C; Voet, H; Krunke, M; Burggraf, P; Meisen, T; Jeschke, S";Semantic information modelling for factory planning projects;"Virtual Production Intelligence; Semantic Information Model; Ontology; Factory Planning";Nowadays, one of the main challenges in factory planning is the consistent and coherent information processing along planning processes. Despite the current efforts in the fields of Virtual Production and Digital Factory, planning and simulation applications mostly support only analyses and optimizations of single planning aspects. To match nowadays challenges, planners require solutions that provide an integrated view on all data generated along planning processes to evaluate planning scenarios in advance and to achieve increasing production quality and efficiency. We have developed an essential solution by combining the 'Condition Based Factory Planning', a flexible planning approach which decomposes the process into standardized planning modules, and the 'Virtual Production Intelligence'. This fusion creates a basis for the integration and analysis of data aggregated along production (planning) processes. The current information model provides factory planners to perform integrated analyses of process characteristics on the bases of module parameters to increase transparency of information flows. In this paper, the enhanced process of semantic information modelling is described to integrate precise planning values within a factory planning project from heterogeneous data sources and to provide a consistent information base within the planning system. Therefore, we define the relevant concepts of the domain and their interrelations in a formalized and explicit way. Furthermore, specific templates for the planning modules are developed to ensure the completeness and high data quality which are then mapped against the information model by means of semantic annotation and interpretation. This approach provides semantic interoperability of planning and simulation applications used in factory planning without the need to change their individual data models and structures. Thus, the business logic of the domain and the technical implementation of the planning system are decoupled which provides a generality of the business logic and a flexible adaption of planning modules.

Thus, shorter product life cycles, an increased number of product varieties, high performance processes, flexible machines and production systems result in an increased complexity in all factory level domains from product design, process development, factory and production planning to factory operation. To handle this complexity, new knowledge-based methods, technologies and tools to model, simulate, optimize and monitor planned and existing manufacturing systems are required. This paper presents the challenges, the approach and an overview of the results of the EU-FP7 funded project Apps4aME (GA No 314156) and provides a concise overview over the Engineering Apps (eApps) approach that the project is based on. The project aims at the comprehensive consideration of ICT-based support of Manufacturing Engineering in all the above mentioned domains, called advanced Manufacturing Engineering (aME). The different life cycles are aligned by the development of a Reference Data Model that provides a detailed overview of all relevant domain-specific and inter-domain interdependencies. This life cycle-oriented model enables an integrated product design, process development, factory planning as well as production planning and factory operation. All stakeholders in these activities are supported by eApps that are conceived, developed and validated with the help of four industrial use cases spanning very diverse industrial branches.

One of these tools is the digital human model (DHM). In the field of production, the focus of using DHMs lies in the planning and evaluation of processes and products in terms of plausibility, productivity and ergonomics. Up to now, ergonomic assessment within DHM simulations have been mostly limited to static evaluations of reachability and postures. INTERACT is a running R&D project, working on the main weak points of DHM software tools. The industry-driven requirements are mainly the reduction of input effort, the increase of movement quality and a quick and intuitive way to create simulation variations in a workshop environment. The utilization of sensor data to create high quality simulations is another point of development. Next to the addressed improvement in productivity and plausibility, these latest advancements also enable automatic ergonomic assessments, including process oriented standards like EAWS, OCRA and NIOSH lifting index. The inclusion of these standards will allow a more holistic ergonomic assessment and therewith expand the fields of application in the industrial environment. This paper will give an insight in the latest developments and the performance of current implementations of automatic ergonomic assessment within digital human models. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Such rich evidence has begun to be used to inform policy-makers, (local) governments, parents, educators, awareness-raisers and even children themselves. However, other relevant stakeholders such as the industry seem to be taking less advantage of this rich knowledge base. Without industry collaboration, the work of media scholars presents a missed opportunity to ensure that children are better protected and empowered and that their rights are taken into consideration in the development of new digital products and services. Merely informing the industry is, however, not enough. Scholars must ensure that their knowledge translates into practical guidelines and concrete solutions to guarantee children's better and safer digital experiences. This can only be achieved by keeping on building new knowledge, but also by exploring new avenues for cooperation and co-creation of child-centred solutions with partners such as the industry, but also with children themselves.

Data and information come from heterogeneous IT systems and from different domains, viewpoints, levels of granularity and life cycle phases causing potential inconsistencies in the data sharing, preventing interoperability. Hence, our aim is to investigate approaches and principles when integrating the digital factory, IT tools and IoT in manufacturing in a heterogeneous IT environment to ensure data consistency.

Thus far, the phenomenon of digital shadow economy has not been universally defined either by scientists or by institutions responsible for the combat with shadow economy. Traditional shadow economy is commonly estimated applying direct and indirect methods possessing their strengths and weaknesses. As a result, final estimations of shadow economies are rather variant. For instance, with reference to Schneider (2014), the scope of shadow economy in Lithuania achieved 27 per cent rate in 2014 whereas the figure estimated by Lithuanian Department of Statistics composed 15 per cent rate. It can be presumed that the divergence of the results has been determined by application of different shadow economy estimation methods. The interviews with the experts of shadow economy have revealed that although the volumes of e-trade and e-transactions are increasing, indicators of digital shadow are not still included in the estimations of shadow economy.

DF is supported by a formal ontology that describes the capabilities of the factory in a formal and machine-understandable fashion and enables capability quantification and visualization. Through exploring and querying the Digital Factories, companies can develop a deeper and more precise understanding of the technological capabilities of prospective suppliers, thus making more informed decisions when building supply chain partnerships. By creating their digital twins, small to medium-sized manufacturers can significantly improve their visibility in the virtual space. Digital Factories also enable automated supply chain formation.

This paper discusses the current options in the usage of analytics by enterprises as well as the existing challenges and elaborates recommendations for the future. Special focus is put on customer-oriented analytics by means of analytical services. In these, the building blocks of analytics are modularized in three layers: Data Interpretation & Cleansing Layer, Data Processing Layer, and Data Visualization Layer. This modularization allows building analytics in a standardized manner. Such services aim at reducing the gap between the holders of expert knowledge and the users of analytics. This is achieved by placing the attention on obtaining the desired information (choosing from a portfolio of analytics) instead of solving fundamental challenges, already addressed by the respective modules.

J;"Martin, B; Newhall, J";TECHNOLOGY AND THE GUILTY MIND: WHEN DO TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS BECOME CRIMINAL ACCOMPLICES?;;"The creators of today's most successful technologies share an important willingness to push the envelope a drive that propels digital industry forward. This same drive, however, can lead some technology purveyors to push the limits of legality or even become scofflaws in their pursuit of innovation or (more often) profit. The United States must figure out how to harness the important creative force at the heart of the hacker ethic while still deterring destructive criminal wrongdoers. Because it is often courts that must answer this question, it is essential to examine the legal doctrines prosecutors use to sweep up technology providers. This Article focuses on one type of criminal liability accomplice liability that can act as a dragnet on providers of technology that lends itself to criminal use. In particular, a violation of the federal statute for aiding and abetting, 18 U.S.C. 2, can be implied in every charge for a federal substantive offense, and there is a potentially troubling strain of cases holding that knowing assistance can be enough to deem someone an aider and abettor, even without stronger evidence of a shared criminal purpose. This Article examines when the proprietors of technology with criminal uses aid and abet their users' crimes. The aim is to help courts, prosecutors, and technologists draw the line between joining a criminal enterprise and merely providing technology with criminal uses. This Article explains the legal doctrines underlying this type of liability and provides examples of at-risk technologies, including spam software, file-sharing services, and anonymity networks like Tor. Ultimately, this Article concludes that the web of superficially conflicting rulings on the required mental state for aiding and abetting are best harmonized and future rulings on liability for new technologies are best predicted by looking to the existence of ""substantial unoffending uses"" for the product or service provided by the accused technologist.";2;2015;54

However, it remains not widespread in the industries, essentially due to the insufficient capability to communicate between the different entities and actors implied in the product development process and so to ensure a global consistency of the product and its production system definition. In this research work, we propose an information system dedicated to the management of data and information of product, production and simulation, which allows the integration of different points of view and the communication between different actors who participate in the Digital Factory process. Such information system has been tested on a case study coming from an industrial context.;5;2015;10

In addition to this, indicative for the present period is the fact that the number of technical components in many products is increasing, and at the same time the requirements are growing for corresponding assembly, transport and logistical processes. These requirements can be administered and recognized in the scope of their complexity only through the use of an array of rapid and efficient methods in the form of a digital factory. This contribution points to the practical application of the Plant Simulation software module from the portfolio of the digital factory of Siemens PLM. This complex instrument with an environment for controlling the life cycle of a product enables repeated utilization of data, supports effective cooperation between individual units, and provides relevant data for each user who needs it, mainly from the viewpoint of strategic decision-making.

J;"Matsuda, M; Kimura, F";Usage of a digital eco-factory for sustainable manufacturing;"Virtual factory; Software agent; Green performance simulation";This paper proposes sustainable manufacturing using a digital eco-factory. When a digital eco-factory is used, green performance is examined in addition to productivity and manufacturability at the same time. A digital eco-factory shows green performance with various granularities such as machine level, product level and factory level. A digital eco-factory is a virtual factory and IT platform for sustainable production planning. In a digital eco-factory, the production scenario is examined by simulating manufacturing processes. The digital eco-factory is configured on a digital factory. The digital factory is constructed by applying multi agent technology. In the digital factory, all factory elements such as machine tools and assembly machines are configured as software agents. A digital factory mirrors the structure of the actual factory. At the usage stage, the user of a digital eco-factory can easily customize the configuration of the factory, target production scenario, granularity of simulation parameters, etc. Furthermore, the digital eco-factory supports execution of planned sustainable production by providing reference data for monitoring and online control of the shop floor. In addition, to practically spread the use of a digital eco-factory, e-catalogue library of machines/devices is proposed. (C) 2015 CIRP.;7;2015;10
J;"Vosniakos, GC; Gogouvitis, XV";Structured design of flexibly automated manufacturing cells through semantic models and petri nets in a virtual reality environment;"Digital factory; Manufacturing system design; Petri nets; Semantic models; Virtual reality";The work presented in this paper outlines a design framework for flexibly automated manufacturing cells in a Virtual Reality environment. Design encompassing structure/configuration and control/operation aspects of manufacturing cells is supported through different levels of analysis. The cornerstone is semantic models that are constructed for stereotypical manufacturing cell objects and their relations but are extensible for new ones. VRML 3D models of these objects are created and introduced into the virtual world. Core methods are developed for object functional control. A major class of methods at object level refers to trivial and non-trivial kinematics for stereotypical objects such as robots, machine tools and conveyors. The main method at cell level pertains to controlling interactions among different manufacturing tasks and is based on definition of control-interpreted Petri Nets at two levels of detail: generic nets, which are less detailed and directly derive from semantic models, and specific nets, which add further detail that cannot be included in a practical way in the semantic nets. Furthermore, special attention is directed to the user within the virtual environment, by providing mostly visual tools that enhance user perception as well as information and manipulation tools that facilitate interaction with the virtual manufacturing cell being designed. The virtual environment was developed from scratch using relatively high-level 3D graphics development tools and open libraries and is thus amenable to extensions.;4;2015;19

Some basic industrial systems are currently integrated via semantic modelling technologies so that products matching processes and resource requirements are integrated to fulfil customer demands. Despite these achievements. product design is still dependent on the knowledge of designers and do not benefit from existing process and resource knowledge. which are in separate domains This paper therefore presents an integration method based on semantic technologies and PPR ontologies to enable the reuse of known and unknown knowledge. The method relies on the use of cloud manufacturing to improve the efficiency of responses generated by querying the PPR ontology.

Now-a-days nanotechnology grasp the major attention of digital industry. Quantum dot Cellular Automata(QCA) came out to be an efficient nanotechnology which can replace existing technologies in nanoscale. One of the well studied and researched variant of QCA is 4 Dot 2 Electron QCA. In the present scope our complete focus will be on 2 Dot 1 Electron QCA which is an emerging variant of QCA. This paper presents an improved design strategy of Ex-OR gate using 2 Dot 1 Electron Quantum Cellular Automata(QCA) which consists of only 23 many 2 Dot 1 Electron QCA cells. The proposed design reduces the number of cells in comparison to the existing Ex-OR gate design in [1]. The proposed design of the EX-OR gate not only ensures high degree of compactness but also a huge reduction in the amount of required energy. This design strategy reduces the energy requirement as well as energy dissipation both upto 15 percent. The proposed Ex-OR gate implementation achieves upto 95.83 percent of compactness which is nothing but an index of area utilization. This design methodology of Ex-OR gate can be utilized to design multiple digital logic circuits. In our present perview we use the Ex-OR gate design to implement different reversible logic gates such as Tofolli gate and Feynman gate. We also suggest the design methodology of the Fredkin gate which is a reversible gate. To the best of our knowledge the designs of reversible gates using 2 Dot 1 Electron QCA have not been reported in literature yet. The proposed designs are analyzed with respect to different energy parameters.;1;2015;6

Reducing the gap between the real and digital world makes the factory environment more flexible, more adaptive, but also demand broader skill of human workers. Interdisciplinary competencies from engineering, information technology, and computer science are required in order to understand and manage the diverse interrelations between physical objects and their digital counterpart.

S;"Constantinescu, CL; Francalanza, E; Matarazzo, D";Towards knowledge capturing and innovative human-system interface in an open-source factory modelling and simulation environment;"Digital Factory; JITIR; SysML";The capital value of knowledge is fundamental in modern cyber-physical systems. The user is provided with information from multiple and sometimes conflicting sources. This large amount of information must then be analyzed and interpreted by the human brain. Information must be used in a profitable way, and transformed into useable knowledge, which can then be effectively used in decision making activities. It is therefore critical to provide the required information and knowledge in order to support digital factory activities such as modelling and simulation of manufacturing systems. The advent and implementation of Industry 4.0 will make it a requirement for virtual planning and real systems within smart factories, to interact and share large quantities of information with each other. In this respect, one of the major challenges is making sure that the right people have the right information, at the right time to make the right decisions. The aim of this research is to provide a multi-level just-in-time simulation tool to support decision making in digital factory planning. The tool makes use of a suitable means for the capturing and representation of manufacturing system knowledge in several types of industrial sectors and types of companies (large, SME). Furthermore, to support the modelling activity, the human-system interface of the simulation tool makes use of just-in-time information retrieval (JITIR). The aim of JITIR is to proactively yet non-intrusively provide the required information at the right time based on the users' context during the modeling and simulation activity.

Key aspects to cope with these developments are the reduction of the unit costs and the planning duration as well as the improvement of the planning quality. In order to overcome these challenges, digital tools can support all phases of factory and process planning. Most of them provide a wide range of functionalities, which require a large invest in software and high operation costs to use them efficiently. Often, small and medium enterprises (SME) cannot afford such invests and operation costs. Therefore, new digital factory planning tools tailored for SMEs supporting the production system planning are required. Main goal of the ""WiES-Pro"" project, funded by the Ministry of Finance & Economics Baden-Wurttemberg, was to develop an engineering environment for production system planning suitable for SMEs. The ""WiES-Pro"" approach connects small specific software tools for production system planning in an integrated platform, capable to share information and knowledge easily. The challenges in the development are to cope with both the heterogeneous data from different sources like machine master data, work plans or product data and the applicability to SMEs. This paper presents the results of the project, consisting of the approach and its implementation. Also the architecture of the browser-based platform and the developed digital factory planning tools for priority graph optimization, assembly process time planning, similarity-based product search and material flow simulation are presented shortly.

S;Juan, HF;Practice and Reflection on the Teaching of Digital Media Art;"digital media art; specialty construction; teaching practice";With the large-scale development of contemporary digital technology, digital media art has had a profound effect on people's lives and generated a huge digital industry. The national universities and colleges have established an additional digital media art specialty to satisfy the requirements of social development. In contrast, the teaching skills of digital media art have lagged behind. Many schools are blindly copying other schools' training plans irrespective of the fact that digital media art is an interdisciplinary and compound discipline. They are also applying backward teaching methods that are short of practical guidance, rendering them incapable of training high-level talents really needed by the market. This paper discusses the problems in the current teaching mainly from the aspects of the specialty construction of digital media art, basic education reformation, curriculum group design, practicality of teaching, balance between technology and art, teaching staff construction and so on based on the status quo of industrial development and talent training in China's higher education. It also attempts to, through exploration, help universities and colleges to cultivate inter-disciplinary talents truly meeting social demand in order to promote the development of digital media art in China.;0;2015;4
